\chapter{The Natural Numbers}

The \emph{natural numbers} have to do with counting: 0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots.
They do not include negatives
or fractions or irrationals.
In this lecture, the structure of natural numbers is the topic.
To hone in on that structure, we look at structures similar to the natural numbers, but that
fail to capture some basic aspects of counting. Bogus structures
are ruled out by axioms that distinguish the structure of natural numbers
from all others.

\begin{goals}
\noindent \textbf{Lecture}
\begin{itemize}
\item Present the natural numbers as comprising a structure suited to counting.
\item Identify similar structures that can not properly represent counting.
\item Rule out ``bad'' structures via axioms.
\end{itemize}

\noindent \textbf{Study}
\begin{itemize}
\item Gain facility in the course's \emph{successor} notation, including
translating between successor notation and base $10$ notation.
\item Commit to memory the axioms of natural numbers.
\item Demonstrate ability to recognize failures of the axioms. 
\end{itemize}
\end{goals}

\section{The Basic Picture}

Natural numbers are pictured like stepping stones in 
Figure \ref{fig:nat-numbers}.

\begin{figure}[h]

Figures \ref{fig:NatSigBad1}, \ref{fig:NatSigBad2} and \ref{fig:NatSigBad3} illustrate three
ways \emph{not} to picture the natural numbers.

These incorrect pictures can be ruled out by explaining the basic structure of counting.

\ipadbreak

%\refstepcounter{axiomCnt}
\begin{signature}{Nat}\label{sig:NatSignature}
The natural numbers have the following basic structure.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item There is a special natural number. We denote this by $0$.
  \item For any natural number $n$, there is
    a unique \emph{next} natural number. We call this the \emph{successor of $n$}. 
    In these lectures, we denote the successor of $n$ by $n^\nxt$.
  \end{itemize}
\end{signature}

%\begin{text-usage}
%	In these notes, bubbles labelled ``Signature'' introduce new notation meant to capture the essential structure of what we are talking about.
%	Here are want to talk about natural numbers as the things we use to count. So the essense is that counting ``starts somewhere'' ($0$) and it ``keeps going'' (any $n$ is followed by $n^\nxt$).
%	Later we will also introduce other notation, for example $+$ for addition and $\leq$ for the greater-than-or-equal-to relation between two numbers. But these are add-ons, not essential to the very idea of counting.
%\end{text-usage}
%
%\begin{usage}
%  The notation $n^\nxt$ is not standard. We will use it in these notes for pedagogical reasons.
%After the first few lectures, we will not need it very often. If you use it in another course, you will need to
%explain it, as it is unlikely that othe professors will know what it means. Clearly, $n^\nxt$ is intended to be the same as $n+1$,
%but we are talking about \emph{counting} not \emph{adding}.
%This notation, in which a natural number is written as $0$ followed by some ${}^\nxt$'s, we will call \emph{successor notation}.  For example,
%$0^{\nxt\nxt\nxt}$ is the successor notation corresponding to the number three.
%\end{usage}

\begin{exercises}
\begin{multicols}{2}
%\begin{itemize}
\item Convert the following to successor notation.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item $9$
  \item $10$
  \item $4 + 3$

  \end{enumerate}
\item Convert the following to base $10$ notation.
\begin{enumerate}
\item $0^{\nxt\nxt\nxt\nxt}$
\item $n^{\nxt\nxt\nxt\nxt\nxt}$

\section{Narrowing the possibilities}

Figures \ref{fig:one-loop} and \ref{fig:two-loop} illustrate 
problems that \ref{ax:NatSignature} does not avoid.

\begin{figure}[h]

  \begin{tikzpicture}
    \node (a) at (0,0) [circle, draw] {$0$}; \node (b) at (2,0)
    [circle,draw] {\phantom{$0$}}; \node (c) at (4,0) [circle,draw]

    \draw[->] (c.east) -- (d.west); \draw[->] (d.north west)
    .. controls (3,1) .. (a.north east);
  \end{tikzpicture}
  \caption{A strange way to count}
  \label{fig:one-loop}
\end{figure}

    \draw[->] (c.east) -- (d.west); \draw[->] (d.north west)
    .. controls (4,.75) .. (b.north east);
  \end{tikzpicture}
  \caption{Another strange way to count}
  \label{fig:two-loop}
\end{figure}

\begin{exercises}
%\begin{itemize}
\item
Explain, in one or two sentences each, why Figures \ref{fig:one-loop} and \ref{fig:two-loop} satisfy Axiom \ref{ax:NatSignature}.
%\end{itemize}
\end{exercises}
\ipadbreak

Figure \ref{fig:one-loop} is flawed because $0$ has a
\emph{predecessor}: a value $n$ satisfying $0^{\nxt\nxt\nxt\nxt} = 0$. Figure
\ref{fig:two-loop} is flawed because an element has two distinct
predecessors: $0^\nxt = 0^{\nxt\nxt\nxt\nxt}$.  We can insist that
these flaws do not happen in the natural numbers. That is, 
we rule them out with axioms.

%\refstepcounter{axiomCnt}
\begin{axiom}\label{ax:NatZero}
  For every natural number $n$, $n^\nxt\neq 0$.
\end{axiom}

%\refstepcounter{axiomCnt}
\begin{axiom}\label{ax:NatPred}
  For any natural numbers $m$ and $n$, if $m^\nxt=n^\nxt$ then $m=n$.
\end{axiom}

These axioms eliminate Figures \ref{fig:one-loop}, \ref{fig:two-loop} and similar pictures.  
But there is still a subtle problem. 
Consider Figure \ref{fig:nonstandard}.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \begin{tikzpicture}
    \node (a) at (0,0) [circle, draw] {$0$}; \node (b) at (2,0)

    \draw[->] (d.east) -- (e.west);
    % \node (z) at (0,2) {\ldots};
    \node (aa) at (2,2) [circle, draw] {$\star$}; \draw[->] (aa.east)
    .. controls (3.5,3) and (0.5,3) .. (aa.west);
    % \node (bb) at (4,2) [circle,draw] {\phantom{$0$}}; \node (cc) at
    % (6,2) [circle,draw] {\phantom{$0$}}; \node (dd) at (8,2)
    % [circle,draw] {\phantom{$0$}}; \node (ee) at (10,2) {\ldots};
    % \draw[->] (z.east) -- (aa.west); \draw[->] (aa.east) --
    % (bb.west); \draw[->] (bb.east) -- (cc.west); \draw[->] (cc.east)
    % -- (dd.west); \draw[->] (dd.east) -- (ee.west);
  \end{tikzpicture}
  \caption{A model of the natural numbers?}
  \label{fig:nonstandard}
\end{figure}

This picture satisfies the two axioms. Yet, it is certainly not a picture of natural numbers because it
has ``extra stuff'' in it ($\star$).
\ipadbreak

To rule out ``extra stuff'', we formulate
our final axiom for natural numbers.  The idea is to diagnose the problem as follows. Were we to erase
the circle labelled $\star$ and any the arrows leading to and from it, the remaining part of
Figure \ref{fig:nonstandard} would still
satisfy live up to the\ref{sig:Nat}. This is exactly what we
mean by ``extra stuff'': elements
that can be removed without violating violating the signature (the essential structure). 
This leads to our last axiom. 

%\refstepcounter{axiomCnt}
\begin{axiom}\label{ax:NatInd}
[The Axiom of Induction] No natural numbers can be removed without violating \ref{sig:Nat}.
\end{axiom}

%Believe it or not, the four axioms we have stated here completely
%characterize the standard picture of the natural numbers. In other
%words, any picture that satisfies these axioms will look the same. A
%rigorous proof of this is possible, but not necessary for now.

and (b) $n$ has no predecessor (that is, $n\neq m^\nxt$ for every $m$). Convince me that
the picture fails to satisfy Axiom \ref{ax:NatInd}.

The latest exercise shows that in the natural numbers, if $n\neq 0$, then $n = m^\nxt$ for some $m$. In other
words, every non-zero natural number has a predecessor.

\section{Basic Arithmetic Operations}

\begin{defn}\label{def:NatArithmetic}
\noindent The \emph{sum} of two natural numbers, $m$ and $n$, is a natural number (denoted by $m+n$). For every natural number $m$, the following 
are true:
\begin{align*}
    m + 0     &= m\\
    m + k^\nxt &= (m + k)^\nxt &&\text{for any natural number $k$}
\end{align*}

\noindent The \emph{product} of two natural numbers, $m$ and $n$, is a natural number 
(denoted by $m\cdot n$). For every natural number $m$, the following are true:
\begin{align*}
  m\cdot 0 &= 0\\
  m\cdot k^\nxt &= m + (m\cdot k) &&\text{for any natural number $k$}
\end{align*}
\end{defn}


A moment's thought about arithmetic should convince you that these equations are reasonable.
Certainly $m+0=m$ and $m\cdot 0 = 0$ should be true for any $m$. 
The second equation for $+$ can be read as saying ``to add $m$ to the successor of $k$,
simply add $m$ to $k$, then take the successor.'' The second equation for $\cdot$
can be read as saying ``to multiply $m$ by the successor of $k$, simply
multiply $m$ by $k$, and add $m$ to the result.''

But it is not the case that any arbitrary pair of equations involving $0$ and $k^\nxt$
will define anything sensible. In the cases of $+$ and $\cdot$, though, 
the Axiom of Induction ensures that there are indeed unique operations
that satisfy the equations. A proof of this fact is not particularly illuminating
right now, so let us agree to take for granted that the equations 
spelled out here actually define addition and multiplication.

\begin{example}
Do the defining equations for addition really explain how to add? Let's use them to calculate
$4+3$:
\begin{align*}
  4 + 3 &= 4 + 0^{\nxt\nxt\nxt}&&\text{[$3$ abbreviates $0^{\nxt\nxt\nxt}$]}\\
  &= 4^\nxt + 0^{\nxt\nxt} &&\text{[$m + k^\nxt = m^\nxt+k$]}\\
  &= 4^{\nxt\nxt} + 0^\nxt &&\text{[Same reason]}\\
  &= 4^{\nxt\nxt\nxt} + 0 &&\text{[Same reason]}\\
  &= 4^{\nxt\nxt\nxt} &&\text{[$m+0 = m$]}\\
  &= (0^{\nxt\nxt\nxt\nxt})^{\nxt\nxt\nxt} && \text{[$4$ abbreviates $0^{\nxt\nxt\nxt\nxt}$]}\\
  &= 0^{\nxt\nxt\nxt\nxt\nxt\nxt\nxt} && \text{[Remove unneeded parentheses]}\\
  &= 7 &&\text{[$7$ abbreviates $0^{\nxt\nxt\nxt\nxt\nxt\nxt\nxt}$]}
\end{align*}
\end{example}
\ipadbreak

\begin{example}
A product can be calculated similarly. Consider $2\cdot 2$.
\begin{align*}
  2\cdot 2 &= 2\cdot 0^{\nxt\nxt} &&\text{[$2$ abbreviates $0^{\nxt\nxt}$]}\\
           &= 2 + (2\cdot 0^\nxt) &&\text{[$m\cdot k^\nxt = m + (m\cdot k)$]}\\
           &= 2 + (2 + (2\cdot 0))&&\text{[Same reason]}\\
           &= 2 + (2 + 0) &&\text{[$m\cdot 0=0$]}\\
           &= 2 + 2&&\text{[$m+0 = m$]}\\
           &= 2 + 0^{\nxt\nxt}&&\text{[$2$ abbreviates $0^{\nxt\nxt}$]}\\
           &= 2^\nxt + 0^\nxt &&\text{[$m+k^\nxt = m^\nxt+k$]}\\
           &= 2^{\nxt\nxt} + 0&&\text{[Same reason]}\\
           &= 2^{\nxt\nxt} &&\text{[$m+0 = m$]}\\
           &= (0^{\nxt\nxt})^{\nxt\nxt} &&\text{[$2$ abbreviates $0^{\nxt\nxt}$]}\\
           &= 0^{\nxt\nxt\nxt\nxt}&&\text{[Remove unnecessary parentheses]}\\
           &= 4 &&\text{[$4$ abbreviates $0^{\nxt\nxt\nxt\nxt}$]}
\end{align*}
\end{example}

We certainly will not want to calculate this way in real life. 
After all, it took twelve steps just to figure $2\cdot 2=4$. But these
examples and the following exercises show how addition and multiplication are
closely tied to simple counting. 

\ipadbreak

\begin{exercises}
%\begin{itemize}
\item Calculate these sums, following the previous example to write
  each step of your calculation explicitly. Include the reason for
  each step (as in the previous example).Take care to lay out the
  chain of equalities correctly, and do not skip any steps.
\begin{enumerate}
\item $2+4$
\item $4+2$
\item $3+(3+1)$
\item $(3+3)+1$
\item $0 + 3$
\end{enumerate}

\item Notice that it takes more steps to calculate $2+4$ than $4+2$, even though we already knew
they would produce the same answer. Explain why.

\item Calculate the following values, writing each step explicity. 
 \begin{enumerate}
    \item $2\cdot 3$
    \item $0\cdot 2$
    \item $2\cdot(2\cdot 2)$
    \item $3\cdot(2 + 1)$
    \item $(3\cdot 2) + (3\cdot 1)$
    \end{enumerate}
\item Write a definition of exponentiation via defining equations. Follow the pattern
of definition I have written for addition and multiplication.
%\end{itemize}
\end{exercises}

\chapter{Laws of Arithmetic}

Before working the last exercises, you knew that $3\cdot (2+1)$ and $3\cdot 2+ 3\cdot 1$
would come out the same because of a law of arithmetic known as \emph{distributivity}. 
Addition and multiplication satisfy several other laws.

\section{Basic Laws}

The following list summarizes several useful laws of
arithmetic on the natural numbers. They are organized to emphasize
similarities between addition and multiplication.

\begin{laws}
\noindent For any natural numbers, $m$, $n$ and $p$:

\begin{tabular}{lr@{\,}l@{\qquad}lr@{\,}l}
\textbf{Associativity}& $m + (n + p)$      &$= (m+n)+p$           &\textbf{Commutativity}&$m + n$    &$= n + m$\\
                      &$m \cdot(n\cdot p)$ &$= (m\cdot n)\cdot p$ &                      &$m\cdot n$ &$= n\cdot m$\\
&&&&&\\ 
\textbf{Identity}&$m + 0$    &$= m$&\textbf{Positivity}&\multicolumn{2}{c}{if $m + n = 0$ then $m=0$}\\
                 &$m\cdot 1$ &$= m$&                   &\multicolumn{2}{c}{if $m\cdot n = 1$ then $m=1$}\\
&&&&&\\
\textbf{Cancellativity}&\multicolumn{2}{c}{if $m + p = n+p$ then $m=n$}&&&\\
                       &\multicolumn{2}{c}{if $m \cdot p^\nxt = n\cdot p^\nxt$ then $m=n$}&&&\\
&&&&&\\
\textbf{Distributivity}&$m\cdot(n+p)$&$= (m\cdot n) + (m\cdot p)$&&&\\
&&&&&\\
\textbf{Case Distinction}&\multicolumn{2}{c}{if $m\neq 0$ then $m=k^\nxt$ for some $k$}&&&\\
\end{tabular}
\end{laws}
\medskip

Most of these laws are familiar and are listed with their common names. The Law of Case
Distinction was the subject of Exercise \ref{exer:cases}. \emph{Go back and look at that exercise again}.
The Law of Positivity for multiplication is not a common name, but
I have used it to emphasize the analogies between addition and multiplication.
Also Case Distinction does not really have a common name. I made that up.

\ipadbreak

\section{Inductive Proofs}

Suppose we wish to prove that every natural number has some
property. For example, let us suppose we wish to prove that every
natural number is \emph{mimsy}.  I have no idea what a mimsy number
is, but let us try to prove this anyway. We could try proving that $0$
is mimsy, $1$ is mimsy, $2$ is mimsy, and so on.  But this won't work
because our proof will never end. In fact, it is not so obvious that
we, humans with finite minds, can ever prove that some property is
true for \emph{all} natural numbers, since it seems to involve
checking infinitely many individual cases.

The Axiom of Induction provides a way forward in spite of our
limitations.  Suppose we were to show that the mimsy natural numbers
all by themselves constitute a picture of Signature
\ref{sig:NatSig}.  Then there could not be any natural numbers
left out, for otherwise, we could erase all the non-mimsy natural
numbers and still have a picture of \ref{sig:Nat}. This
is exactly what the Axiom of Induction forbids: we can not erase
\emph{anything} without breaking the signature.

So to prove that all natural numbers are mimsy, we simply need to
prove that
\begin{itemize}
\item $0$ is mimsy, and
\item for all natural numbers $k$, if $k$ is mimsy so is $k^\nxt$.
\end{itemize}
From these, we conclude that the mimsy natural numbers by themselves form a picture of \ref{sig:Nat}. So the Axiom of Induction ensures that all natural numbers
are mimsy.

%\begin{usage}
%  A proof employing the Axiom of Induction in this way is called a
%  proof \emph{by simple arithmetic induction}, or just a proof \emph{by
%    induction}, for short.  We will see more general forms of
%  induction later.
%\end{usage}

To make inductive proofs easier to understand, we often write them
using a three step outline, as illustrated here.
\begin{itemize}
\item{}[Basis] Prove that $0$ is mimsy.
\item{}[Inductive Hypothesis] Assume that $k$ is mimsy.
\item{}[Inductive Step] Prove that $k^\nxt$ is mimsy. [You may use the
  assumption that $k$ is mimsy in this part of the proof.]
\end{itemize}

More practical examples are next.

\begin{fact}

  \emph{Addition is associative.}

\begin{proof}
  We need to show that $m + (n+p) = (m+n)+p$ for all $m$, $n$ and $p$.
  Let us suppose that $m$ and $n$ are fixed values (not known to us).
  We now prove that the values $p$ for which $m+(n+p) = (m+n)+p$ holds
  form a picture of \ref{sig:Nat}.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item{}[Basis] $m+(n+0) = m+n = (m+n)+0$. Both steps are due to the
    defining equations of $+$.
  \item{}[Inductive Hypothesis] Assume $m+(n+k) = (m+n)+k$.
  \item{}[Inductive Step] We must show that $m+(n+k^\nxt) =
    (m+n)+k^\nxt$. 
    \begin{align*}
      m+(n+k^\nxt) &= m + (n+k)^\nxt &&\text{[Def. of +]}\\
      &= (m+(n+k))^\nxt&&\text{[Same]}\\
      &= ((m+n)+k)^\nxt&&\text{[Inductive Hypothesis]}\\
      &= (m+n)+k^\nxt &&\text{[Def. of $+$]}
    \end{align*}
  \end{itemize}
  Therefore (by the Axiom of Induction), $m+(n+p) = (m+n)+p$ holds for
  all $p$. Since the argument does not depend on any extra assumptions
  about $m$ and $n$, it holds for all $m$ and $n$.
\end{proof}
\end{fact}

%\begin{usage}
  We say this proof is \emph{by induction on $p$} to emphasize that
  the variable $p$ is the focus of attention. The other variables are
  not directly involved in the structure of the proof.
%\end{usage}

The remainder of this section further illustrates the technique of
simple arithmetic induction via proofs of other laws of arithmetic.

\begin{fact}\label{lem:AddZero}
  $0$ is the identity for addition.

\begin{proof}
  We must prove that $m+0 = m = 0 + m$ for all $m$. The first equality is true by the definition of $+$.
  But the second equality, $m = 0 + m$, is not explicitly one of the defining facts about $+$. So we proceed by induction on $m$.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item{}[Basis] $0+0 = 0$ is true by definition of $+$.
  \item{}[Inductive Hypothesis] Assume $0 + k = k$.
  \item{}[Inductive Step] We must show that $0 + k^\nxt = k^\nxt$.
    \begin{align*}
      0 + k^\nxt &= (0+k)^\nxt &&\text{[Def. of $+$]}\\
      &= k^\nxt &&\text{[Inductive hypothesis]}
    \end{align*}
  \end{itemize}
  Therefore, $0+m=m$ holds for all $m$.
\end{proof}
\end{fact}

To prove that addition is commutative, we need an additional fact
about how successor and addition interact.

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:AddSucc}
  For any $m$ and $n$, $(m + n)^\nxt = m^\nxt + n$.

 \begin{proof}
   By induction on $n$:
   \begin{itemize}
   \item{}[Basis]
     \begin{align*}
       (m + 0)^\nxt &= m^\nxt     &&\text{[Def. of $+$]}\\
       &= m^\nxt + 0 &&\text{[Def. of $+$]}
     \end{align*}
   \item{}[Inductive Hypothesis]
    Assume $(m + k)^\nxt = m^\nxt + k$ for some $k$.
   \item{}[Inductive Step]
    We must show that $(m + k^\nxt)^\nxt = m^\nxt + k^\nxt$.
    \begin{align*}
      (m + k^\nxt)^\nxt &= ((m + k)^\nxt)^\nxt && \text{[Def. of $+$]}\\
                     &= (m^\nxt + k)^\nxt &&\text{[Inductive Hypothesis]}\\
                     &= m^\nxt + k^\nxt   &&\text{[Def. of $+$]}
    \end{align*}
   \end{itemize}
So $(m + n)^\nxt = m^\nxt + n$. Because the proof does not depend on any assumption about $m$, it is valid
for all $m$.
 \end{proof}
\end{lemma}

\begin{fact}

  \emph{Addition is commutative.}

\begin{proof}
  We need to show that $m+n = n + m$ for all $m$ and $n$.  This time,
  the proof is by induction on $m$. Fix a value for $n$.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item{}[Basis] $0 + n = n = n + 0$ holds because of Fact
    \ref{lem:AddZero} and the definition of $+$.
  \item{}[Inductive Hypothesis] Assume that $k + n = n + k$ for some
    $k$.
  \item{}[Inductive Step] We must show that $k^\nxt + n = n + k^\nxt$.
    \begin{align*}
      k^\nxt + n &= (k + n)^\nxt&&\text{[Lemma \ref{lem:AddSucc}]}\\
      &=  (n+k)^\nxt&&\text{[Inductive Hypothesis]}\\
      &= n + k^\nxt&&\text{[Def. of $+$]}
    \end{align*}
  \end{itemize}
  Therefore, $m + n = n + m$ for all $m$. Since this argument does not
  depend on any assumptions about $n$, it is valid for all $n$.
\end{proof}
\end{fact}
\ipadbreak

\begin{fact}
  \emph{Addition is cancellative.}

\begin{proof}
  We need to prove that if $m + p= n+p$, then $m=n$.  This proof is a little subtler than the previous ones. But notice that is
  still follows the same form.
  
  The proof is by induction on $p$. Assume that $m$ and $n$ are some fixed natural numbers.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item{}[Basis] Suppose $m+0 = n+ 0$. Then immediately by definition
    of $+$, $m=n$.
  \item{}[Inductive Hypothesis] Assume that the following statement is true for some $k$: if $m + k = n + k$ then $m=n$.
  \item{}[Inductive Step] We must show that 
    if $m+k^\nxt = n+k^\nxt$ then $m=n$. Suppose $m+k^\nxt = n + k^\nxt$ [call this (*) for reference]. Then
    \begin{align*}
      (m+k)^\nxt & = m + k^\nxt &&\text{[Def. of $+$]}\\
      & = n + k^\nxt &&\text{[By the supposition (*)]}\\
      & = (n+k)^\nxt &&\text{[Definition of $+$]}
    \end{align*}
    Hence, by Axiom \ref{ax:NatPred} $m+k=n+k$. So by the Inductive Hypothesis, $m=n$.
  \end{itemize}
  Therefore, $m + p = n + p$ implies $m = n$ for all $p$. Since this argument does not
depend on any assumptions regarding $m$ and $n$, it is valid for all $m$ and $n$.
\end{proof}
\end{fact}

To prove that multiplication is commutative and cancellative, we will
need the following technical facts (analogous to Lemmas
\ref{lem:AddZero} and \ref{lem:AddSucc}).

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:MultZero}
  $0\cdot n = 0$

  \begin{proof}
    The proof is by induction on $n$.
    \begin{itemize}
    \item{}[Basis] $0\cdot 0 = 0$ by definition of $\cdot$.
    \item{}[Inductive Hypothesis] Assume that $0\cdot k = 0$ for some
      $k$.
    \item{}[Inductive Step] We must show that $0\cdot k^\nxt = 0$.
      \begin{align*}
        0\cdot k^\nxt &= 0 + 0\cdot k &&\text{[Definition of $\cdot$]}\\
        &= 0 + 0 &&\text{[Inductive Hypothesis]}\\
        &= 0&&\text{[Definition of $+$]}
      \end{align*}
    \end{itemize}
  \end{proof}
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:MultSucc}
  $m^\nxt \cdot n = m\cdot n + n$

 \begin{proof}
   The proof is by induction on $n$.
   \begin{itemize}
   \item{}[Basis] $m^\nxt\cdot 0 = 0 = 0+0 = m\cdot 0 + 0$ all follow
     from the definitions of $+$ and $\cdot$.
   \item{}[Inductive Hypothesis] Assume that $m^\nxt\cdot k = m\cdot k +
     k$ for some $k$.
   \item{}[Inductive Step] We must show that $m^\nxt\cdot k^\nxt =
     m\cdot k^\nxt + k^\nxt$.
     \begin{align*}
       m^\nxt\cdot k^\nxt &= m^\nxt + m^\nxt\cdot k &&\text{[Def. of $\cdot$]}\\
       &= (m + m^\nxt\cdot k)^\nxt &&\text{[Lemma \ref{lem:AddSucc}]}\\
       &= (m + (m\cdot k + k))^\nxt && \text{[Inductive Hypothesis]}\\
       &= ((m+ m\cdot k) + k)^\nxt &&\text{[Associativity of $+$]}\\
       &= (m\cdot k^\nxt + k)^\nxt &&\text{[Def. of $\cdot$]}\\
       &= m\cdot k^\nxt + k^\nxt &&\text{[Def. of $+$]}
     \end{align*}
   \end{itemize}
 \end{proof}

Other laws are left as exercises.

\begin{exercises}
  % \begin{enumerate}
\item Prove that $1$ is the identity for multiplication. That is $1\cdot m = m  = m\cdot 1$.
\item Prove that multiplication distributes over addition [$m\cdot
  (n+p) = m\cdot n + m\cdot p$] by induction on $p$.  You can use the
  fact that addition is associative and commutative because we have
  already proved those.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Prove the basis: $m\cdot(n+0) = m\cdot n + m\cdot 0$.
  \item Write the inductive hypothesis.
  \item Prove the inductive step: $m\cdot(n+k^\nxt) = m\cdot n +
    m\cdot k^\nxt$
  \end{enumerate}
 
\item Prove that multiplication is associative [$m\cdot(n\cdot p) =
  (m\cdot n)\cdot p$] by induction on $p$.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Prove the basis: $m\cdot (n\cdot 0) = (m\cdot n)\cdot 0$.
  \item Write the inductive hypothesis.
  \item Prove the Inductive Step: $m\cdot (n\cdot k^\nxt) = (m\cdot
    n)\cdot k^\nxt$. Hint: Use the Law of Distribution, which you just
    proved.
  \end{enumerate}

\item Prove that multiplication is commutative. Hint: Use the two facts

For the record, we also prove the cancellation law for multiplication. This is 
a bit harder than the exercises, but you should try to find your own proof before looking at mine.

\begin{fact}

  \emph{If $m\cdot p^\nxt = n\cdot p^\nxt$, then $m=n$.}

\begin{proof}
  The proof is by induction on $n$.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item{}[Basis] Suppose $m\cdot p^\nxt = 0\cdot p^\nxt$. From Fact
    \ref{lem:MultZero}, $m+ m\cdot p = m\cdot p^\nxt = 0$. So the Law of
    Positivity for addition ensures that $m=0$.
  \item{}[Inductive Hypothesis] Assume that for some $k$, the following is true:
    if $m\cdot p^\nxt = k\cdot p^\nxt$, then $m=k$.
  \item{}[Inductive Step] Suppose that $m\cdot p^\nxt = k^\nxt \cdot
    p^\nxt$. Then
    \begin{align*}
      m\cdot p^\nxt &= k^\nxt\cdot p^\nxt &&\text{[By assumption]}\\
      &= k\cdot p^\nxt + p^\nxt &&\text{[Lemma \ref{lem:MultSucc}]}\\
      &= (k\cdot p^\nxt + p)^\nxt &&\text{[Definition of $+$]}\\
      &\neq 0 &&\text{[Axiom Nat \ref{ax:NatZero}]}
    \end{align*}
    Consequently, $m\neq 0$, for otherwise we would have $m\cdot
    p^\nxt = 0$. Since $m$ is not equal to $0$, it is equal to some
    successor (by the Case Distinction Law). Let $j$ be the predecessor of $m$,
	so that $j^\nxt=m$.
    \begin{align*}
      j\cdot p^\nxt + p^\nxt & m\cdot p^\nxt &&\text{[Lemma \ref{lem:MultSucc}]}\\
      &= k^\nxt \cdot p^\nxt &&\text{[By supposition]}\\
      &= k\cdot p^\nxt + p^\nxt &&\text{[Lemma \ref{lem:MultSucc}]}
    \end{align*}
    Because addition is cancellative, $j\cdot p^\nxt = k\cdot
    p^\nxt$. Now, the Inductive Hypothesis ensures that $j=k$. Hence
    $m = j^\nxt = k^\nxt$.
  \end{itemize}
\end{proof}
