\setOverview{
The mathematical universe consists of various things: numbers, functions, graphs, lists and so on.
A \noexpand\emph{set} is a collection of things. 
For example, the collection of all natural numbers is a set.
A \noexpand\emph{function} is a correlation of the members of one set with members of another set.
These two abstract concepts (sets and functions) form a conceptual framework in which virtually all of mathematics can be built.
So an understanding of sets and functions is key to a rigorous approach to most other parts of mathematics.
This conceptual framework can itself be put on a formal, precise footing called the Category of Sets and Functions.

In these lectures, we build up the Category of Sets and Functions, so that we can use these things as the basic building blocks of everything else we do.

\section*{Introduction}

\emph{Sets} are the mathematician's way of thinking about \emph{collections} of objects. Examples will be the set of natural numbers, the set of pairs of natural numbers, the set of lists of natural numbers, and so on.
\emph{Functions} are the mathematicians way of thinking about operations, such as successor, addition, summation, and so on.

Mathematicians also use functions to model attributes of the things in a collection, like ``the color of'', ``the mass of'', ``the location of'', ``the father of'', ``the favorite book of the person to the left of'' and so on.
There is little sense in saying these are ``operations'', but they have a similar behavior. For each potential
object $x$ of the right sort (a wooden building block, for example), \emph{the color of $x$} is a specific color. Similarly,
any specific natural number $n$, ``the successor of $n$'' is another specific natural number. So ``the color of'' is a function
from the set of wooden bulding blocks to the set of colors; ``the successor of''
is a function from the set of natural numbers to set of natural numbers. Likewise, addition constitutes a function from the set of 
pairs of natural numbers to the set of natural numbers. In English we might say ``the sum of $m$ and $n$'', but we usually write $m+n$. 
Either way, any pair of natural numbers has a sum. So ``the sum of'' is an attribute of pairs of natural numbers, just like ``the color of'' is an attribute of wooden building blocks.

Taken together, sets and functions constitute a fundamental structure in contemporary mathematics called the \emph{Category of Sets and Functions}. 
This is a slight lie.
Actually, there are many different categories of sets that differ in subtle ways. 
But for most mathematics, the differences are irrelevant.
So in practice, it is safe to talk as if there is just one category of sets.
The Category of Sets and Functions sometimes abbreviated as \textbf{Set}.

To understand sets and functions as they are used in every day mathematics, we need to answer some questions:
\begin{itemize}
	\item What do we mean by saying that a set is a collection?
	\item What do we mean by saying that two sets are equal?
	\item What do we mean by saying that a function behaves like an attribute?
	\item What do we mean by saying that two functions are equal?
\end{itemize}
The answers to these leads to some basic principles for reasoning about sets and functions. 
In addition, we ways to construct sets and functions with specific behaviors. 
These lead to further principles of set and function construction.

\section*{Sets}

A set is a collection of things that are ``in'' the set. All other things are ``not in'' the set. 
For example, later we will see that the natural numbers constitute a set $\NN$. 
So $0$ is in $\NN$, $1$ is in $\NN$, and so on, but $\frac{1}2$ is not in $\NN$.
We make this precise and introduce notation for the idea.

\begin{signature}\label{sig:SetSignature}
  A \emph{set} is a mathematical entity $A$ with the following feature. 
  For any thing $x$, either $x$ \emph{is in} $A$ or $x$ \emph{is not in} $A$. 
  We write $x\in A$ if $x$ is in $A$ and $x\notin A$ if $x$ is not in $A$.

The symbol $\in$ is used in mathematics exclusively to indicate membership in a set. 
You will not see it used in any other way.  

For variety, all of the following phrases mean the same thing:
\begin{itemize}
\item $x$ is in $A$
\item $x$ is an \emph{element of} $A$
\item $x$  is a \emph{member of} $A$
\item $A$ \emph{contains} $x$
\item $x$ \emph{belongs to} $A$
\end{itemize}
\end{signature}

Basic Vocabulary \ref{sig:SetSignature} describes how we can talk about sets and elements, and how to use the notation of membership, but does not tell us that any sets actually exist. 
We will remedy that in the next sections.
Our first remedy is to make room for finite sets.

\begin{axiom}[Finite Sets] For any list $L  = [a_0,\ldots, a_{n-1}]$, there is a set, denoted by $\{a_0,\ldots,a_{n-1}\}$, so
  that $x\in \{a_0,\ldots, a_{n-1}\}$ if and only if $x=a_i$ for some
  $i<n$.  More precisely,
  \begin{itemize}
  \item $x\notin \{\}$ for any $x$ (so $\{\}$ is said to be \emph{empty});
  \item $x\in \{a_0,\ldots,a_n\}$ if and only if $x=a_0$ or $x\in
    \{a_1,\ldots,a_n\}$.
  \end{itemize}
\end{axiom}

\begin{example}
Here are some examples of sets built from finite lists:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\{\}$ -- an empty set;
\item $\{1,2,5\}$ -- a set consisting of three elements;
\item $\{\{\}\}$ -- a set consisting of one element, which is $\{\}$;
\item $\{1,2,4,\{1,2\}\}$ -- a set consisting of four elements, $1$,
  $2$, $4$ and the set $\{1,2\}$.
\item $\{4,5, \{\}, [\,]\}$ -- a set consisting of four elements. Note that
the set $\{\}$ and the list $[\,]$ are not the same things.
\item $\{1,2,3,4,3,2,1\}$ -- a set consisting of four elements, listing an element twice is redundant.
\end{itemize}
\end{example}

The study of finite sets is surprisingly complex, and comprises a large part of
the branch of mathematics called \emph{combinatorics}. We will touch on some basics
of combinatorics later in the course. 

Various infinite sets of numbers also exist. All of these are indeed sets (that is, their existence follows from general principles
of set theory), but we will not try to justify that explicitly, except for the set of natural numbers.

\begin{defn}
	The following sets are denoted by special symbols:
	\begin{align*}
		\NN &= \text{the set of natural numbers}
		\ZZ &= \text{the set of integers}\\
		\QQ &= \text{the set of rational numbers}\\
		\RR &= \text{the set of real numbers}\\
		\CC &= \text{the set of complex numbers}
	\end{align*}
\end{defn}

\begin{exercises}

    \begin{enumerate}
    \item $1\in A$

    \end{enumerate}
  \item In the following examples of sets with elements following a pattern, write an expression for the same set
  that makes the pattern clearer.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item $\{0,2,4,\ldots, 100\}$
  \item $\{1,2,4,8,\ldots, 256\}$
  \item $\{0,1,3, 6, 10,\ldots, 55\}$
  \end{enumerate}
  \end{enumerate}
\end{exercises}

\section*{Subsets}

Sets are meant to be bare collections. For a set $A$, some things are in $A$, some are not. And that's all we can say.
Unlike a list, a set has no ``initial'' element of a set.
For example, the set $\{1,2,3\}$ should be the same as the set $\{2,3,1\}$, because both have the same elements. This is an important difference between
lists and sets: $[1,2,3]$ and $[2,3,1]$ are \emph{not} the same lists because order matters in lists. 
To make this precise, we need to be clear about when sets are equal. To do this, we introduce an important definition.

\begin{defn}
  For sets $A$ and $B$, we say that \emph{$A$ is a subset of $B$} provided that every element of $A$ is an element of $B$. We also
  write this as $A\subseteq B$, and say that \emph{$A$ is included in $B$}.  We may also write $B\supseteq A$ 
  to mean the same thing, and say that \emph{$B$ is a superset of $A$}.

  If $A$ is \emph{not} a subset of $B$, we write $A\not\subseteq B$. If $A\subseteq B$ and $B\not\subseteq A$, then $A$ is called a
  \emph{proper subset of $B$}. To indicate that $A$ is a \emph{proper} subset of $B$, we may write $A\subsetneq B$.
\end{defn}

Saying $A\subseteq B$ is exactly the same as saying that for any $x$, if $x\in A$ then $x\in B$.

\begin{example}
  Here are some examples and counter-examples of the subset relation.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item $\{1,2,3\}\subseteq \{0,1,2,3\}$
  \item $\{\}\subseteq \{0\}$
  \item $A\subseteq A$ for any set $A$ because, trivially, every
    element of $A$ is an element of $A$
  \item $\{\} \subseteq A$ for any set $A$ because every element of
    $\{\}$ (there are none) is an element of $A$
  \item $\{1,2,3\}\not\subseteq \{0,2,3\}$ because $1\in \{1,2,3\}$
    but $1\notin \{0,2,3\}$
  \item $\{1,2,3\}\subseteq \{2,3,1\}$
  \end{itemize}
\end{example}

\ipadbreak

\begin{exercises}
	For each of the following pairs of sets, determine whether or
  not the first is a subset of the second. Explain your answer.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item $\{0,1\}$ and $\{1,0\}$
  \item $\{a,b,c,d\}$ and $\{a,b,d,e,c\}$
  \item $\{\}$ and $\{\{\}\}$
  \item $\{0,3,6,10\}$ and $\{10,9,8,7,6,5,4,2,1, 0\}$
  \end{enumerate}
\end{exercises}

\section*{Equal Sets}

We can summarize two
useful properties of $\subseteq$ as follows.
\begin{itemize}
	\item{}[Reflexivity]  For any set $A$, $A \subseteq A$. We say $\subseteq$ is \emph{reflexive}.
	\item{}[Transitivity] For any sets $A$, $B$ and $C$,
	if $A\subseteq B$ and $B\subseteq C$, then $A\subseteq C$. We say $\subseteq$ is \emph{transitive}.
\end{itemize}
Another familiar example of a reflexive, transitive
relation is $\leq$ on the natural numbers. In fact there are many examples of reflexive transitive relations throughout mathematics. 

The relation $\leq$ is also \emph{anti-symmetric}, meaning that if $m\leq n$ and $n\leq m$ then $m=n$. 
Suppose $A\subseteq B$ and $B\subseteq A$. Then, by definition $A$ and $B$ have the exact same elements.  By our understanding of sets as collections,
$A$ and $B$ must be equal. So we state this as another axiom.

\begin{axiom}\label{ax:set-extensionality}
[\textbf{The Axiom of Set Extensionality}]
For sets $A$ and $B$, if $A\subseteq B$ and $B\subseteq A$, then $A=B$. In other words, $\subseteq$ is anti-symmetric.
\end{axiom}

Based on this, we can already establish a useful fact: there is exactly one empty set. To set the tone for what follows, we make this a formal claim.

\begin{lemma}
	There is exacty one empty set.
\begin{proof}
	We have already noted that the set built from an empty list $\{\,\}$ has no elements. So there is at least one empty set.
	
	Suppose $E$ is a set with no elements. Then $E\subseteq \{\,\}$ because every element of $E$ (there are none) is an element of $\{\,\}$. Similarly, $\{\,\}\subseteq E$ because every element of $\{\,\}$ (again, there are none) is an elemen of $E$. So by Axiom~\ref{ax:set-extensionality} $E = \{\,\}$.
\end{proof}
\end{lemma}

\begin{defn}
  The set $\{\}$ is also denoted by $\emptyset$. This is a universally accepted symbol for the empty set.
\end{defn}

Set extensionality makes precise the idea that a set by itself does
not have any structure other than what members it possesses.
To emphasize this, sometimes it is useful to
depict a set with elements scattered about something like \usetikzlibrary{fit,shapes}
\[\begin{tikzpicture}[ >=stealth, bullet/.style={ fill=black, circle,
    minimum width=1pt, inner sep=2pt }, projection/.style={ ->, thick,
    shorten <=2pt, shorten >=2pt }, every fit/.style={ ellipse, draw,
    inner sep=2pt } ]
  \foreach \x/\y/\l in {0.4/1/d,-0.2/2/c/,0/3/b,0.5/4/a}
  \node[bullet,label=left:$\l$] (a\y) at (\y,\x) {};
  \node[draw,fit=(a1) (a2) (a3) (a4),minimum width=2cm] {} ;
\end{tikzpicture}
\]
with the elements scattered about. Evidently, a re-arrangement of the
elements does not change the depicted set. So
\[\usetikzlibrary{fit,shapes}
\begin{tikzpicture}[ >=stealth, bullet/.style={ fill=black, circle,
    minimum width=1pt, inner sep=2pt }, projection/.style={ ->, thick,
    shorten <=2pt, shorten >=2pt }, every fit/.style={ ellipse, draw,
    inner sep=2pt } ]
  \foreach \x/\y/\l in {0.3/2/d,-0.2/3/c/,0/4/b,-0.5/1/a}
  \node[bullet,label=left:$\l$] (a\y) at (\y,\x) {};
  \node[draw,fit=(a1) (a2) (a3) (a4),minimum width=2cm] {} ;

\end{tikzpicture}
\]
is the same set. Depicting a subset of a set is a simple
matter of drawing a smaller boundary around some of the elements as in the following.
\[\usetikzlibrary{fit,shapes}
\begin{tikzpicture}[ >=stealth, bullet/.style={ fill=black, circle,
    minimum width=1pt, inner sep=2pt }, projection/.style={ ->, thick,
    shorten <=2pt, shorten >=2pt }, every fit/.style={ ellipse, draw,
    inner sep=2pt } ]
  \foreach \x/\y/\l in {0.3/2/d,-0.2/3/c/,0/4/b,-0.5/1/a}
  \node[bullet,label=left:$\l$] (a\y) at (\y,\x) {};
  \node[draw,fit=(a1) (a2) (a3) (a4),minimum width=2cm] {} ;
  \node[draw, fit = (a2) (a3), minimum width=2cm] {};
\end{tikzpicture}
\]

\emph{Functions}
(perhaps in your calculus courses) are often talked about as \emph{operations}. 
For example, \[f(x) = x^2-1\]
can be seen as an operation that transforms a number $x$ into its
square. But it can also be seen as an attribute (the ``square of
$x$''). The ``operational'' view is informal, and often useful. As we will see,
though, it gets an important aspect of functions wrong because
two entirely different operations may define the same function.

Informally, a function ``takes'' an argument from a given set as input and ``produces'' an output in a given set.
So the function $f$ defined by $f(x)=x^2 + 2x + 1$ might ``take'' the natural number $2$
and ``produce'' the natural number $10$. That is, $f(3)=3^2 + 1 = 10$. 
We begin by introducing the vocabulary of functions.

\begin{signature}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item For a set $A$ and a set $B$, there are things called 
	\emph{functions from $A$ to $B$}, with a function $f$ from $A$ to $B$ 
	being writing $\fromto fAB$ or $A\stackrel{f}{\to} B$. 
	
	\item For $\fromto fAB$, the set $A$ is called the \emph{domain} of $f$
	and $B$ is called the \emph{codomain} of $f$.
	
	\item For any function $\fromto fAB$ and every element $a\in A$, $f$ and $a$ determine an element of $B$,
	written $f(a)$, and read ``$f$ of $a$''.
	\end{itemize}
\end{signature}

A functions may sometimes also be called a \emph{map}, a \emph{transformation}, or an \emph{operation}. 
As we will see, however, \emph{operation} is somewhat misleading. 

Often, a function $\fromto fAB$ is \emph{defined} by a rule, just as they are familiar in other parts of mathematics. 
We typically, write such rules by giving the function a name (very often $f$) and spelling out the rule at the same time.
So we write things like
\[f(x)=x^2 + 4x + 2\]
to define a function $\fromto f\RR\RR$ (recall that $\RR$ is the set of real numbers).
But sometimes it is useful to have a rule without giving it a name.
To do that, we use the ``maps to'' arrow $\mapsto$.
So we might define the same function $f$ by saying that \emph{$f$ is given by the rule $x\mapsto x^2 + 4x + 2$}. 
We will not go so far as to write $f = (x\mapsto x^2+4x+2)$ because this more easily understood by writing $f(x)=x^2+4x+2$.
The rule $x\mapsto x^2  4x + 2$ is the same as the rule $y\mapsto y^2 + 4y + 2$. 
The variable only serves as a place holder, so its particular name does not matter.

There are two fundamental (trivial) types of rules that can be used to build functions.

\begin{axiom}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item For any set $A$, there is a function $\fromto {\id_A}AA$ defined by the rule $x\mapsto x$.
		This is called the \emph{identity} function on $A$
		\item For any two functions $\fromto fAB$ and $\fromto gBC$, there is a function $\fromto {g\circ f}AC$ defined by the rule $x\mapsto g(f(x))$.
		This is called the composition of $g$ and $f$ (or sometimes ``$g$ following $f$'').
	\end{itemize}
\end{axiom}


Notice that $g\circ f$ is only defined when the \emph{domain} of $g$ matches the codomain of $f$.
Also, be careful about definitions like $f(x)=1/x$.
This does not define a function on the real numbers because $f(0)$ is undefined.
In other words, to be a function, $f$ must determine an element of the codomain for each element of the domain.

To depict a function on small sets, we can use the simple internal diagrams of the last section. For example,
\[
  \begin{tikzpicture}[
    >=stealth,
    bullet/.style={
      fill=black,
      circle,
      minimum width=1pt,
      inner sep=1pt
    },
    projection/.style={
      ->,
      thick,
      shorten <=2pt,
      shorten >=2pt
    },
    every fit/.style={
      ellipse,
      draw,
      inner sep=0pt
    }
  ]
    \foreach \x/\y/\l in {0.4/1/d,-0.2/2/c/,0/3/b,0.5/4/a}
      \node[bullet,label=left:$\l$] (a\y) at (\x,\y) {};

    \foreach \x/\y/\l in {4.1/1/4,3.2/2/3,4.3/3/2,4/4/1}
      \node[bullet,label=right:$\l$] (b\y) at (\x,\y) {};

    \node[draw,fit=(a1) (a2) (a3) (a4),minimum width=2cm] {} ;
    \node[draw,fit=(b1) (b2) (b3) (b4),minimum width=2cm] {} ;

    \draw[projection] (a1) -- (b4);
    \draw[projection] (a2) -- (b2);
    \draw[projection] (a3) -- (b1);
    \draw[projection] (a4) -- (b3);
  \end{tikzpicture}
\]
depicts a function from the set $\{a,b,c,d\}$ to the set $\{1,2,3,4\}$.

Composition can be illustrated using internal diagrams.
For example,
  \[
    \begin{tikzpicture}[
      >=stealth,
      bullet/.style={
        fill=black,
        circle,

        dashed,
        shorten <=2pt,
        shorten >=2pt
      },
      every fit/.style={
        ellipse,
        draw,
        inner sep=0pt
      }
    ]
      \foreach \x/\y/\l in {0.4/1/d,-0.2/2/c/,0/3/b,0.5/4/a}

\section*{Equal Functions and External Diagrams}

Just like sets, we need a way to say when two functions are equal.
Let $\NN$ denote the set of natural numbers. 
Then define $\fromto f\NN\NN$ by
\[f(n) = n^2 +  2n + 1.\]
Likewise, define $\fromto g\NN\NN$ by
\[g(n) = (n+1)^2.\]
Evidently, for each $n\in\NN$, it is true that $f(n) = g(n)$.
So even though $f$ and $g$ are defined by different \emph{operations}, the two functions yield the same results.
As with sets, this leads to an axiom for equality of functions.

\begin{axiom}[\textbf{The Axiom of Function Extensionality}]
	For functions $\fromto fAB$ and $\fromto gAB$, if it is the case that $f(x)=g(x)$ for all $x\in A$, then $f=g$.
	Note that equality of functions only makes sense when the two functions share the same domain and the same codomain.
\end{axiom}

If we not concerned about the detailed internals sets, but only with how functions interact, then function can be depicted very simply as $A\stackrel{f}{\longrightarrow} B$.
So a composition of functions can be depicted as in
\[
\tikzset{>=stealth}
\begin{tikzpicture}[every node/.style={midway}]
\matrix[column sep={4em,between origins},
        row sep={2em}] at (0,0)
{ \node(A)   {$A$}  ; & \node(B) {$B$}; \\
                      & \node(C) {$C$}; \\};
\draw[->] (A) -- (B) node[anchor=south]  {$f$};
\draw[->] (B) -- (C) node[anchor=west]  {$g$};
\draw[->,red] (A) -- (C) node[anchor=north east] {$g\circ f$};
\end{tikzpicture}
\]
We do not really need to draw $g\circ f$ as a separate arrow because the \emph{path} from $A$ to $B$ to $C$ is already implicitly a depiction of $g\circ f$.
So the simpler diagram 
\[
\tikzset{>=stealth}
\begin{tikzpicture}[every node/.style={midway}]
\matrix[column sep={4em,between origins},
        row sep={2em}] at (0,0)
{ \node(A)   {$A$}  ; & \node(B) {$B$}; \\
                      & \node(C) {$C$}; \\};
\draw[->] (A) -- (B) node[anchor=south]  {$f$};
\draw[->] (B) -- (C) node[anchor=west]  {$g$};
\end{tikzpicture}
\]
shows the same information, namely, that $\fromto fAB$ and $\fromto gBC$ are functions and therefore, $g\circ f$ is too.

Now a diagram such as this
\[
\tikzset{>=stealth}
\begin{tikzpicture}[every node/.style={midway}]
\matrix[column sep={4em,between origins},
        row sep={2em}] at (0,0)
{ \node(A)   {$A$}  ; & \node(B) {$B$}; \\
  \node(D)   {$D$}  ; & \node(C) {$C$}; \\};
\draw[->] (A) -- (B) node[anchor=south]  {$f$};
\draw[->] (B) -- (C) node[anchor=west]  {$g$};
\draw[->] (A) -- (D) node[anchor=east] {$h$};
\draw[->] (D) -- (C) node[anchor=north] {$k$};
\end{tikzpicture}
\]
depicts two composite functions $g\circ f$ and $k\circ h$, but $g\circ f$ and $k\circ k$ may not be equal.
We say that the diagram \emph{commutes} or that it is a \emph{commutative diagram} if $g\circ f = k\circ h$.
In other words, saying that a certain diagram commutes \emph{is} an assertion that certain functions are equal.


\begin{exercises}
\begin{enumerate}
\item  For each of the following pairs of functions $\NN\to\NN$, determine whether they are equal and explain why or why not.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item $f(n) = 2n + 3$ and $g(m) = 2m + 3$
  \item $f(n) = 2^{n+1} - 1$ and $g(n) = \sum_{i=0}^n2^i$
  \item $f(n) =  n^2 + 5n + 6$ and $g(n) = (n+3)(n+2)$
  \item $f(n) = n^4 - 10n^3 + 35n^2 + 50n + 24$ and $g(n) = 24$
  \end{enumerate}
\item Let $\RR$ denote the set of all real numbers. Let $f(x) = \tan(x)$.
Explain why this does \emph{not} define a function from $\RR$ to $\RR$.
\item Suppose the following functions exist: $\fromto fAB$, $\fromto gBC$, $\fromto aAD$, $\fromto bCD$. 
  Draw a commutative diagram asserting that $b\circ g\circ f = a$.
\item Suppose the following functions exist: $\fromto fCA$, $\fromto gCB$, $\fromto hCP$, $\fromto pPA$ and $\fromto qPB$.
 Draw a commutative diagram asserting that $f=p\circ h$ and $g=q\circ h$.

\section{Introduction}

So far, we have been able to think mainly about finite sets and a few informally defined functions on, say, the real numbers or the natural numbers.
To fill out out understanding of sets, we need to be able to build sets for specific purposes.
Two finite sets will play a particularly important role.
The first, which we denote by $\One$, is  set with one element; the second, which we denote by $\Two$, is a set with two elements.
It does not matter at all \emph{what} elements are in these because, as we will soon see, any two sets of the same size are interchangible.
What `interchangible' means is discussed later.
What `same size' means is obvious for finite sets, but not at all obvious for infinite ones.
We discuss the general situation later as well.

For the time being, we merely need to agree on a fixed set with one element and a fixed set with two elements.
The particular choices I make here will be clearer as we put them to use.

\begin{defn}
	Let $\bullet$, $\bot$ and $\top$ be fixed sybmols. Then define
	\begin{align*}
		\One &= \{\bullet\}\\
		\Two &= \{\bot,\top\}
	\end{align*} 
	The single element of $\One$ is intended to look like a generic point in an internal diagram.
	The element $\top$ is meant to remind you of the letter `T' (short for `True') and $\bot$ is meant to be the opposite of $\top$ (that is, 'False').
\end{defn}


\section{Elements, Pointers and Constant Functions}

Suppose we are told that $\fromto p\One A$ is a function.
Since $\bullet\in\One$, this function determines an element of $A$, namely $p(\bullet)$.
A picture of the situation might be this:
\[
  \begin{tikzpicture}[
    >=stealth,
    bullet/.style={
      fill=black,
      circle,
      minimum width=1pt,
      inner sep=1pt
    },
    projection/.style={
      ->,
      thick,
      shorten <=2pt,
      shorten >=2pt
    },
    every fit/.style={
      ellipse,
      draw,
      inner sep=0pt
    }
  ]
    \node[bullet] (p) at (0,2.5) {};

    \foreach \x/\y/\l in {4.1/1/4,3.2/2/3,4.3/3/2,4/4/1}
      \node[bullet,label=right:$\l$] (a\y) at (\x,\y) {};

    \node[draw,fit=(p),minimum width=1cm, minimum height=1cm] {} ;
    \node[draw,fit=(a1) (a2) (a3) (a4),minimum width=2cm] {} ;

    \draw[projection] (p) -- (a3);
  \end{tikzpicture}
\]
Since $\One$ has only a single element, it can ``point'' only to a single element of $A$.
So we might refer to a function $\One\to A$ as a \emph{pointer} into $A$.
Each pointer determines an element of $A$. And conversely, it should be
possible to point to any element of $A$. This leads to our first axiom guaranteeing that certain functions exist.

\begin{axiom}
	For any set $A$, and any $a\in A$, there is a pointer $\fromto {\hat a}\One A$ so that $\hat{a}(\bullet)=a$.
\end{axiom}

This principle justifies the drawing of internal diagrams for pointers because it means that any such diagram does indeed depict an actual function. 
Other principles that we will discuss later justify our use of internal diagrams for all finite sets.
We could specify $\hat{a}$ by the rule $x\mapsto a$.
That is, since $\bullet$ is an element of $\One$, $\hat{a}(\bullet)=a$.
And since $\bullet$ is the only element of $\One$, $\hat{a}{x}=a$ is true for \emph{every} element of $\One$.

Suppose $\fromto fA\One$ and $\fromto gA\One$ are functions, that is, their \emph{codomain} is $\One$ instead their \emph{domain}. 
Then $f(a)=g(a)$ is true for every $a\in A$ because $\bullet$ is the only possible value for $f(a)$ and $g(a)$. 
So $f=g$ by extensionality.
In other words, there is at most one function from $A$ to $\One$.
But the rule $x\mapsto \bullet$ is as simple a rule as one can imagine. 
This leads to another axiom.

\begin{defn}
	A set $T$ is \emph{terminal} if it is the case that for any set $A$ there is exactly one function from $A$ to $T$.
\end{defn}

\begin{axiom}
	The set $\One$ is a terminal set. 
	We denote the unique function from $A$ to $\One$ by $\fromto {\Diamond_A}{A}\One$.
\end{axiom} 

The rule defining $\Diamond_A$ must be
	\[x\mapsto\bullet\]
because no other rule is possible. 

Using $\Diamond_A$ and $\hat{b}$ for an element $b\in B$, we can now define constant functions. 
That is $\hat{b}\circ\Diamond_A$ is a function from $A$ to $B$ defined by 
\[(\hat{b}\circ\Diamond_A)(x) = \hat{b}(\Diamond_A(x))= \hat{b}(\bullet) = b.\] 
In short, this is the function sending any element of $A$ to the constant result $b$. 

\begin{exercises}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Show that for any pointer $\fromto p\One A$, it is the case that $\widehat{p(\bullet)}=p$.
		\item Show that any set with exactly one element is a terminal set.
		\item Suppose that $\fromto fAB$ is a function. Show that for every $a\in A$, $\widehat{f(a)} = f\circ \hat{a}$.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{exercises}

\section{Solution Sets, Subsets, Characteristic Functions}

Suppose we are given two functions that are ``parallel'': $\fromto fAB$ and $\fromto gAB$.
Then for some value $a\in A$, it might be the case that $f(a)=g(a)$.
We could call such a value a \emph{particular solution to the equation $f(x)=g(x)$}. 
It might be the case that there are no particular solutions.
For example, there are no natural numbers $n$ such that $n+1 = n$. 
On the other hand, there might be many particular solutions. 
For example, let $f(x)=x^3$ and let $g(x)= 6x^2 - 11x + 6$ both as functions on the natural numbers.
Then it is easy to check that $1$, $2$ and $3$ solve the equation.
In fact, these three are the only particular solutions.
We generalize as follows.

\begin{defn} 
	For two functions $A\doublerightarrow{f}{g} B$, a \emph{solution} is a function $\fromto sCA$ so that 
	\[f\circ s = g\circ s.\]
	Thus for example, if $a\in A$ is a particular solution then the pointer $\hat a$ is a solution. 

	For functions $\fromto fAB$ and $\fromto gAB$, an \emph{equalizer} is solution $\fromto eEA$ so that for any solution $\fromto sCA$, there is exactly one function $\fromto hCE$ so that \[e\circ h = k.\]
\end{defn}

\begin{axiom}
	For functions $\fromto fAB$ and $\fromto gAB$, the collection of all particular solutions to the equation $f(x)=g(x)$ form a set, denoted by $\{x\in A\st f(x) = g(x)\}$. 
	The function $\fromto i{\{x\in A\st f(x)=g(x)\}}A$ given by the rule $x\mapsto x$ (called an \emph{inclusion map}) is an equalizer for $f$ and $g$.
\end{axiom}

This axiom tells us two things.
First, we can form a subset of $A$ by specifying an equation $f(x)=g(x)$ for any two functions $\fromto {f,g}AB$, and picking out the particular solutions.
Second, a subset formed in this way ``embeds'' in the given set $A$ by its inclusion map.
Notice that the rule for the inclusion map is the same as the rule for an identity map. 
The difference is only that, here, the domain is a subset of the codomain.

Suppose $c\in C$ and $\fromto fAC$ is a function, then we can form the equalizer of $f$ and the constant function $\hat{c}\circ\Diamond_A$.
This is more easily written we $\{x\in A\st f(x)=c\}$. Since it common to pick out sets like this, special notation is in order.

\begin{defn}\label{def:inverse-image}
	For a function $\fromto fAC$, and a value $c\in C$, 
	\[f^{-1}(c) = \{x\in A\st f(x)=c\}.\] 
	In this case, $f^{-1}(c)$ is called the \emph{inverse image of $c$ with respect to $f$}.
\end{defn}

Evidently, in Definition \ref{def:inverse-image}, the set $f^{-1}(c)$ is a subset of $A$. It would be good to know that any subset of $A$ can be described as an inverse image.
This is where $\Two$ plays a role.

\begin{defn}
	A \emph{pointed set} is a set $A$ with a fixed distinguished element $a_0\in A$.
	A \emph{subset classifier} is a set pointed set $S$ with element $t\in S$ so that for any set $A$ and any subset $B\subseteq A$, there is exactly one function $\fromto kTA$ so that $B = k^{-1}(t)$.
	That is, $B$ is uniquely defined as an inverse image of $t$ with respect to a function into $T$.
\end{defn}

\begin{axiom}
	The set $\Two$ with the distiguished element $\top$ is a subset classifier.
	For subset $B\subseteq A$, the function corresponding to $B$, called the \emph{characteristic function of $B$}, is denoted by $\kappa_B$.
	In other words, $\kappa_B$ is the unique function for which $B = \kappa_B^{-1}(\top)$.
\end{axiom}

For $B\subseteq A$, the characteristic function is defined by the rule
\[
x \mapsto
	\begin{cases}
		\top &\text{ if } x\in B\\
		\bot &\text{ otherwise}
	\end{cases}
\]

\section{Product Sets and Functions of Two Variables}

We should be able to deal with functions of more than one argument, such as a function $f(x,y) = x+y$.
To account for such functions, we take our cue from Descartes.
He studied the plane in terms of a coordinate system consisting of the so-called $x$-axis and $y$-axis.
Once we have decided where to place the axes, a pair $(2,3)$ determines a point on the plane, and any point in the plane $p$ determines a pair.
So Descartes realized that we might as well just say that the plane actually \emph{is} the collection of all pairs of real numbers.
What makes this work is that points in the plane \emph{project} onto the two axes.
Products of sets generalize this idea.

\begin{defn}
For sets $A$ and $B$, a \emph{table} consists of two functions $A\stackrel{f}{\longleftarrow} C\stackrel{g}{\longrightarrow}B$.
Note that the two functions have the same domain. We may call the two functions \emph{legs}.

For sets $A$ and $B$, a \emph{product of $A$ and $B$} is a table $\fromto pPA$ and $\fromto qPB$ so that for any table $\fromto fCA$ and $\fromto gCB$, there is exactly one function $\fromto hCP$ for which $f = p\circ h$ and $g= q\circ h$. 
For a product, the functions $p$ and $q$ are called the \emph{projections}.
\end{defn}

\begin{axiom}
	For sets $A$ and $B$, the collection of all pairs $(a,b)$ where $a\in A$ and $b\in B$ is a set, denoted by $A\times B$. 
	The functions $\fromto {\pi_0}{A\times B}A$ and $\fromto {\pi_1}{A\times B}B$ defined by the rules $\pi_0(a,b)=a$
	and $\pi_1(a,b)=b$ are projections. For $\fromto fCA$ and $\fromto gCB$, the unique function required by
	the product may be denoted by $\langle f,g\rangle$.
\end{axiom}

For $\fromto fCA$ and $\fromto gCB$, the function $\fromto {\langle f,g\rangle}C{A\times B}$ is defined by 
the rule $\langle f,g\rangle(x)=(f(x),g(x))$.

Suppose we are given two unrelated functions $\fromto fAB$ and $\fromto gCD$. We can now form a single function
from $A\times C$ to $B\times D$ by combining $f$ and $g$ ``independently''. That is, define $f\times g = \langle f\circ \pi_0,g\circ \pi_1\rangle$. Calculating concretely in terms of elements $(f\times g)(x,y) = (f(x),g(y))$. 

\section{Function Sets, Partial Evaluation and $\lambda$ Notation}

A function from $A$ to $B$ might depend on a parameter from $C$. 
For example, the function $\fromto f\RR\RR$ defined by the rule $f(x) = \sin(x + c)$ depends on the constant $c$.
There is a related function $\fromto g{\RR\times \RR}\RR$ defined by $g(c,x) = \sin(x+c)$. Evidently, $g$
describes the same behavior as $f$, but it makes the parameter explicit. This leads to the following definition.

\begin{defn}
	For sets $A$ and $B$, a \emph{parametric function from $A$ to $B$} is a function $\fromto g{C\times A}B$ for some set $C$.
	The set $C$ is the \emph{set of parameters}.
	
	Suppse $\fromto f{D\times A}B$ is a parametric function with parameter set $D$ and $\fromto kCD$ is a function.
	Then we can form another parametric function with parameters in $C$ by composition: $f\circ (k\times \id_A)$.
	In this setting, we may refer to $k$ as a \emph{change of parameters} function because $k$ transforms
	the parametric function with parameters in $D$ into a parametric function with parameters in $C$. Specifically, $f\circ(k\times \id_A)$ is given by the rule $(c,a)\mapsto f(k(c),a)$. 
	
	An \emph{evaluation map} for $A$ and $B$ is a parameteric function $\fromto a{F\times A}B$, so that for any 
	parametric function $\fromto g{C\times A}B$ there is exactly one change of parameters $\fromto hCF$ so that
	$g = a\circ (h\times \id_A)$. In that case, $F$ is called a \emph{function set} or an \emph{exponential}.
\end{defn}

\begin{axiom}
	For sets $A$ and $B$, the collection of all functions from $A$ to $B$, denoted by $B^A$, is a set. Moreover,
	there is an evaluation map $\fromto \alpha{B^A\times A}B$ defined by the rule $(f,x) \mapsto f(x)$.
	The unique change of parameters function corresponding to $\fromto f{C\times A}B$ does not have a completely standard name. Some mathematicians honor the twentieth century logician names Haskell Curry by refering to this as `currying'. For these lectures, we follow that tradition and write $\curry[f]$ 
	for the unique function satisfiying $f = \alpha\circ (\curry[f] \times \id_A)$.
\end{axiom}

Consider a rule $x\mapsto E$ where $E$ is some expression involving $x$. For example,
in the rule $x\mapsto x^2$ the $E$ is the expression $x^2$. If $E$ is interpreted as belonging
to $B$ whenever $x$ belongs to $A$, then the rule $x\mapsto E$ determines a function from $A$
to $B$. The logician Alonzo Church proposed to write $\lambda x.E$ to denote the function
from $A$ to $B$ given by the rule $x\mapsto E$. The technicalities of how to make this idea rigorous are rather involved. But for our purposes, we can use the notation informally. So for example, $\lambda x.x^2$
can be used to denote the function from $\RR$ to $\RR$ given by $x\mapsto x^2$. Of course, the
same expression also denotes a function from $\ZZ$ to $\ZZ$, $\QQ$ to $\QQ$ and so on. So we should
exercise care. Generally, the domain (the set over which $x$ ranges) and the codomain (the set over which 
$E$ ranges) need to be specified to interpret $\lambda x.E$ correctly.

Suppose $\fromto f{C\times A}B$ is a parametric function. 
Then the unique function $\curry[f]$ must satisfy $\alpha(\curry[f](c),a) = f(c,a)$. 
But the definition of $\alpha$ means that $\curry[f]$ is the function given by the rule 
$x\mapsto \lambda y.f(x,y)$. So $\curry[f](x)$ is a function from $A$ to $B$ given by the rule
$y\mapsto f(x,y)$.

\section{Powersets and Relations}

The exponential $\Two^A$ for any set $A$ is the set of all characteristic maps on $A$. So the elements of $\Two^A$ correspond
to subsets of $A$, and vice versa. For technical reasons, it makes sense also to suppose that the actual collection of subsets of a set also form an exponential.

\begin{axiom}
	For any set $A$, the collection of subsets of $A$ is a set, denoted by $\powerset(A)$, and called the \emph{power set of $A$}. Moreover, the parametric function $\fromto \ni{\powerset(A)\times A}\Two$ defined by 
	\[\ni(B,x) = \begin{cases}
		\top, &\text{ if } x\in B\\
		\bot &\text{otherwise}
	\end{cases}
	\]
	is an evaluation map. 
\end{axiom}

The axiom (with the definition of the term \emph{evaluation map}) means that any $\fromto k{C\times A}\Two$ determines a function $\fromto hC{\powerset(A)}$ satisfying $a\in h(c)$ if and only if $k(c,a)=\top$.
But this same $k$ also determines a subset of $C\times A$ by $\{(c,a)\in C\times A\st k(c,a)=\top\}$. So evidently functions $C\to\powerset(A)$, 
functions $(C\times A)\to \Two$, functions $C\to \Two^A$ and subsets of $C\times A$ are all essentially the same things.

\section{When are Two Sets Essentially the Same}

Most of the constructions so far, follow a pattern. 
We define some sort of gadget (a terminal object, an equalizer, a product, an exponent) by virtue of how it relates to other similar gadgets (solutions, tables, parametric functions).
In each case, the definition requires that there is exactly one function that relates the general gadget  to the special one. 
Then a corresponding principle asserts that a particular example can be constructed: $\One$, $\{x\in A\st f(x)=g(x)\}$, $A\times B$ and $B^A$.  The way we have used $\Two$ as a subset classifier does not quite follow this pattern, but it very close. Namely, we define ``subset classifier'' in terms of the existence of unique functions for some purpose. Then the corresponding principle says that $\top\in \Two$ is such a thing.

There is some ``obvious'' sense in which $B\times A$ and $A\times B$ are essentially the same. 
After all, the only difference between them is the order in which we choose to write pairs: $(a,b)$ or $(b,a)$. 
So even though $A\times B$ and $B\times A$ are not generally \emph{equal}, we would like to say they are
essentially the same.
Similarly, there is nothing special about $\One$, except that it as a single element. 
So $\{0\}$, $\{\emptyset\}$ or any other singleton is a terminal set, hence essentially the same as $\One$.
 
We would rather have a precise, technical meaning when we say two sets are essentially the same. The key idea
is that we may think of a function $\fromto fAB$ as a systematic way to ``substitute'' elements of $B$ 
for elements of $A$. Two sets are essentially the same if their elements can be substituted back and forth
with no resulting change.

\begin{defn}
	An \emph{isomorphism} is a function $\fromto fAB$ so that there is some function $\fromto gBA$ 
	satisfying $\id_A = g\circ f$ and $\id_B = f\circ g$. In that case, the set $A$ is said to be \emph{isomorphic to $B$}. The function $g$ is called an \emph{inverse of $f$}.
\end{defn}

Some basic facts are handy.

\begin{lemma}
	The following are true:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item If $\fromto fAB$ is an isomorphism and $\fromto gBA$ is an inverse of $f$, then $g$ is an isomorphism	and $f$ is an inverse of $g$.
		\item If $\fromto gBA$ and $\fromto {g'}BA$ are inverses of $\fromto fAB$, then $g=g'$.
		\item If $\fromto fAB$ and $\fromto gBC$ are isomorphisms, then so is $g\circ f$.
		\item For any set $A$, the function $\id_A$ is an isomorphism.
		\begin{proof}
			The first claim is obvious since the two defining conditions $g\circ f=\id_A$ 
			and $f\circ g=\id_B$ are interchangible. For the second claim, suppose $g\circ f = \id_A = g'\circ f$
			and $f\circ g = \id_B = f\circ g'$. Then
			\begin{align*}
				g &= g\circ \id_B\\
				  &= g\circ (f\circ g')\\
				  &= (g\circ f)\circ g'\\
				  &= \id_A\circ g'\\
				  &= g
			\end{align*}
			For third claim suppose suppose $\fromto hBA$ is an inverse of $f$ and $\fromto kCB$ is
			an inverse of $g$, then $(h\circ k)\circ (g\circ f) = \id_A$ and $(g\circ f)\circ(h\circ k)=\id_B$. So $h\circ k$ is inverse of $g\circ f$. The fourth claim is trivial as $\id_A$ is its own inverse.
		\end{proof}
\end{lemma}

From this, we can define what it means for sets $A$ and $B$ to be \emph{isomorphic}.

\begin{defn}
	Sets $A$ and $B$ are \emph{isomorphic}, written $A\simeq B$ if there is an isomorphism $\fromto fAB$.
\end{defn}

The lemma indicates that $A\simeq A$ is always true, that $A\simeq B$ implies $B\simeq A$, and that $A\simeq B$ and $B\simeq C$ implies $A\simeq C$. 
We say that $\simeq$ is an \emph{equivalence} on sets.
It  captures what we mean be saying two sets are essentially the same. 
Also, when $f$ is an isomorphism, there is exactly one inverse. 
Although the notation can be confused with other usages (like inverse image), when $f$ has an inverse it is typically denoted by $f{-1}$.

Returning to the definitions of this lecture, all of them are characterized \emph{up to isomorphism}, meaning
that is a terminal set, an equalizer of $f$ and $g$, a product of $A$ and $B$, an exponent of $A$ over $B$, or a subset classifier if and only if it is isomorphic the $\One$, $\{x\in A\st f(x)=g(x)\}$, $A\times B$, $B^A$ or $\Two$, respectively. We make that more explicit in the following lemma.

\begin{lemma}
	The following are all true:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item A set $C$ is a terminal set if and only if $C\simeq \One$.
		\item For functions $A\doublerightarrow{f}{g} B$:
			\begin{itemize} 
				\item If $\fromto eEA$ is an equalizer, then $E\simeq \{x\in A\st f(x)=g(x)\}$. 
				\item If $\fromto hE\{x\in A\st f(x)=g(x)\}$ is an isomorphism, then $\fromto {(i\circ h)}EA$ is an equalizer.
			\end{itemize}
		\item For sets $A$ and $B$:
			 \begin{itemize}
				 \item If $A\stackrel{p}{\longleftarrow}P\stackrel{q}{\longrightarrow}B$ is a product, then $P\simeq A\times B$. 
				 \item If $\fromto hP{A\times B}$ is an isomorphism, then $A\stackrel{\pi_0\circ h}{longleftarrow} P \stackrel{\pi_1\circ h}{\longrightarrow}B$ is a product.
				 \end{itemize}
		\item If $t\in S$ is a subset classifier, then $S\simeq \Two$ and the isomorphism sends $t$ to $\top$.
		If $\fromto hC\Two$ is an isomorphism, then $h^{-1}(\top)in C$ is a subseet classifier.
		\item For sets $A$ and $B$:
		\begin{itemize} 
			\item If $\fromto a{F\times A}B$ is an evaluation map, then $F\simeq B^A$.
			\item If $\fromto hF{B^A}$ is an isomorphism, then $\fromto \beta{F\times A}B$ is an evaluation map
		given by $\beta(x,y) = \alpha(h(x),y)$.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{enumerate}
	\begin{proof}
		The proofs for all five of these follow a similar pattern. We prove the claim for products
		and leave the others as exercises. 
		
		Suppose $A\stackrel{p}{\longleftarrow}P\stackrel{q}{\longrightarrow}B$ is a product of $A$ and $B$.
		Then $\langle p,q\rangle$ is a function from $P$ to $A\times B$ satisying $p=\pi_0\circ \langle p,q\rangle$ and $q = \pi_1\circ \langle p,q\rangle$. But since $P$ is a product, there is also a function
		$\fromto h{A\times B}P$ so that $\pi_0 = p\circ h$ and $\pi_1\circ h$. Now we can compute
		$p\circ h\circ \langle p,q\rangle = \pi_0\circ \langle p,q\rangle = p$
		and likewise $q\circ h\circ \langle p,q\rangle = q$. But since $p\circ \id_P = p$
		and $q\circ \id_P = q$, $h\circ \langle p,q\rangle = \id_B$. Form a similar calculation,
		$\langle p,q\rangle\circ h = \id_{A\times B}$. Hence $h$ is an isomorphism with inverse $\langle p,q\rangle$.
		
		On the other hand suppose $\fromto hP{A\times B}$ is an isomorphism. Then let $p = \pi_0\circ h$ and $q = \pi_1\circ h$, so $A\stackrel{p}{\longleftarrow} P \stackrel{q}B$ is a table. Consider any table
		$A\stackrel{f}{\longleftarrow}C\stackrel{g}{\longrightarrow}B$. Then $h^{-1}\circ \langle f,g\rangle$ is a function from $C$ to $P$ satisfying
		$p\circ h^{-1} \circ \rangle f,g\langle$ = \pi_0\circ \langle f,g\rangle = f$
		and $q\circ h^{-1} \circ \rangle f,g\langle$ = \pi_1\circ \langle f,g\rangle = g$.
		Moreover, if $p \circ m = f$ and $q\circ m = g$, then 
		\begin{align*}
			h^{-1} \langle f,g\rangle &= h^{-1}\circ \langle p\circ m, q\circ m\rangle\\
			 &= h^{-1}\circ h\circ m\\
			 &= m
		\end{align*}
		So $h^{-1}\circ\langle f,g\rangle$ is the unique function satsifying $p\circ h^{-1}\circ \langle f,g\rangle = f$ and $q\circ h^{-1}\circ \langle f,g\rangle = g$.  
	\end{proof}
\end{lemma}

\section{Introduction}

We have used $\NN$ informally to denote the set of natural numbers. It is time that we make the structure 
of the natural numbers explicit,  and investigate what role the natural numbers play in our theory of sets and functions

 As we studied in previous lectures, the basic vocabulary of natural numbers is that (i) there is a starting natural number, $0$ and (ii) for each natural number $n$
there is a next one, $n^\nxt$. To put the successor in the language of sets and functions, we can 
say that successor is a function $\fromto \succ\NN\NN$ given by the rule $n\mapsto n^\nxt$.
So $\NN$ is not only a set. It comes with functions $\One\stackrel{\hat{0}}{\longrightarrow}\NN\stackrel{\succ}{\longrightarrow}\NN$.

Suppose $\One\stackrel{\hat{b}}{\longrightarrow}A\stackrel{r}{\longrightarrow}A$ is a similar structure.
Then apparently, we can define a function $\fromto f\NN{A}$ so that $f(0)=b$, $f(1)=r(b)$, $f(2)=r(r(b))$,
and so on. In general, $f(n)$ is determined by repeatedly applying $r$ to $b$ a total of $n$ times.
We can make this precise as follows.

\begin{defn}
	A \emph{succession} is a set with functions $\One\stackrel{\hat{b}}{\longrightarrow}C\stackrel{r}{\longrightarrow}C$.
	
	A \emph{countably infinite set} is a succession $\One\stackrel{\hat{z}}{\longrightarrow}N\stackrel{s}{\longrightarrow}N$ so that for any other succession
	$\One\stackrel{\hat{b}}{\longrightarrow}C\stackrel{r}{\longrightarrow}C$, there is exactly one
	function $\fromto f\NN C$ so that $f(z)=b$ and $f\circ s = r\circ f$.
\end{defn}

\begin{axiom}
	The collection of natural numbers is a set, denoted by $\NN$. Moreover, $\One\stackrel{\hat{0}}{\longrightarrow}\NN\stackrel{\succ}{\longrightarrow}\NN$.
makes $\NN$ a countably infinite set.
\end{axiom}

In some settings, a countably infinite set is called a \emph{natural numbers object}. In other settings, the phrase ``countably infinite'' is used to refer to a set that is ``the same size as $\NN$.'' In the latter setting, $\NN$ is regarded as being a fixed ``standard of measure'', sort of like marks on a platinum-iridium bar sitting in a temperature controlled vault in Paris used to be \emph{the} standard meter.\footnote{Meter was originally defined to be 1 ten millionth of the distance from the equator to the north pole along a great circle passing through Paris. It is now defined in a way that can be measures very accurately in a laboratory: it is the distance travelled by light in vacuum during a time interval of 1/299 792 458 of a second measured by a cesium-133 atomic clock. Everyone has one of those.}
