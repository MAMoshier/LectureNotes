\setOverview{
The mathematical universe consists of various things: numbers, functions, graphs, lists and so on.
A \noexpand\emph{set} is collection of things. 
For example, the collection of all natural numbers is a set.
A \noexpand\emph{function} is a correlation of the members of one set with members of another set.
These two abstract concepts (sets and functions) form a conceptual framework in which virtually all of mathematics can be built.
So an understanding of sets and functions is key to a rigorous approach to most other parts of mathematics.
This conceptual framework can itself be put on a formal, precise footing called the Category of Sets and Functions.
In these lectures, we investigate the Category of Sets and Functions, so that we can use these things as the basic building blocks of everything else we do.

\emph{Sets} are the mathematician's way of thinking about \emph{collections} of objects. Examples will be the set of natural numbers, the set of pairs of natural numbers, the set of real numbers, and so on.

An example is a set representing poker cards. We may denote it by
\begin{align*}\symb{Deck}=\{&A\clubsuit,2\clubsuit,3\clubsuit,4\clubsuit,5\clubsuit,6\clubsuit,7\clubsuit,8\clubsuit,9\clubsuit,10\clubsuit, J\clubsuit,Q\clubsuit,K\clubsuit,\\
&A\diamondsuit,2\diamondsuit,3\diamondsuit,4\diamondsuit,5\diamondsuit,6\diamondsuit,7\diamondsuit,8\diamondsuit,9\diamondsuit,10\diamondsuit, J\diamondsuit,Q\diamondsuit,K\diamondsuit,\\
&A\spadesuit,2\spadesuit,3\spadesuit,4\spadesuit,5\spadesuit,6\spadesuit,7\spadesuit,8\spadesuit,9\spadesuit,10\spadesuit, J\spadesuit,Q\spadesuit,K\spadesuit,\\
&A\heartsuit,2\heartsuit,3\heartsuit,4\heartsuit,5\heartsuit,6\heartsuit,7\heartsuit,8\heartsuit,9\heartsuit,10\heartsuit, J\heartsuit,Q\heartsuit,K\heartsuit\}
\end{align*}
The elements are arranged here conveniently, but we could just as well have listed the cards in any ``shuffled'' order. The set of them would be the same.

\emph{Functions} are the mathematicians way of thinking about operations, such as successor, addition, summation, and so on.

Mathematicians also use functions to model attributes of the things in a collection, like ``the color of'', ``the mass of'', ``the location of'', ``the father of'', ``the favorite book of the person to the left of'' and so on.
For our example of cards in a poker deck, ``rank of'' or ``suit of'' are two attributes. So we might write $\rank(A\diamondsuit) = A$ and $\suit(A\diamondsuit)=\diamondsuit$.
In general, $\rank(x)$ and $\suit(x)$ pick out these attributes of any card $x$.
Thus $\symb{Rank} = \{A,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,J,Q,K\}$ 
and $\symb{Suit} = \{\clubsuit, \diamondsuit,\spadesuit,\heartsuit\}$ are also sets.
There is little sense in saying that $\rank$ and $\suit$ are ``operations'', but they are functions \emph{from} $C$ to $R$ and $C$ to $S$, respectively.

The functions $\rank$ and $\suit$ capture some structure of the elements of $C$. In particular, for any rank $r$ and any suit $s$, there is exactly one card $c$ so that $\rank(c)=r$ and $\suit(c)=s$. 
For example, if $\rank(c)=4$ and $\suit(c)=\spadesuit$, then we know exactly what $c$ must be. So the two functions, in a sense, explain what a card is. We will use functions and sets to discuss more complicated structures, but the idea will be very similar to this simple example.

Taken together, sets and functions constitute a fundamental structure in contemporary mathematics called the \emph{Category of Sets and Functions}. 
This is a slight lie.
Actually, there are many different categories of sets that differ in subtle ways. 
But for most mathematics, the differences are irrelevant.
So in practice, it is safe to talk as if there is just one category of sets.
The Category of Sets and Functions sometimes abbreviated as \textbf{Set}.

To understand sets and functions as they are used in every day mathematics, we need to answer some questions:
\begin{itemize}
	\item What do we mean by saying that a set is a collection?
	\item What do we mean by saying that two sets are equal?
	\item What do we mean by saying that a function behaves like an attribute?
	\item What do we mean by saying that two functions are equal?
\end{itemize}
The answers to these leads to some basic principles for reasoning about sets and functions. 
Other principles allow us to construct sets and functions to reflect specific
structure. For example it will turn out that $C$ (the set of cards) can be constructed as $R\times S$ (the set of ranks times the set of suits).
We could be more formal and present these principles as \emph{axioms}, but the word ``axiom''
has a special connotation in mathematics that we do not need here. Nevertheless, everything we say in these lectures could be presented formally.  

\section{Set Basics}

A set consists of things that are ``in'' the set. All other things are ``not in'' the set. In our running example, $A\spadesuit$ is in the set $C$, but $25$ is not in $C$. Let us make the idea precise.

\begin{signature}\label{sig:SetSignature}
  A \emph{set} is a mathematical entity $A$ with the following feature. 
  For any thing $x$, either $x$ \emph{is in} $A$ or $x$ \emph{is not in} $A$. 
  We write $x\in A$ if $x$ is in $A$ and $x\notin A$ if $x$ is not in $A$.

The symbol $\in$ is used in mathematics exclusively to indicate membership in a set. 
You will not see it used in any other way.  

For variety, all of the following phrases mean the same thing:
\begin{itemize}
\item $x$ is in $A$
\item $x$ is an \emph{element of} $A$
\item $x$  is a \emph{member of} $A$
\item $A$ \emph{contains} $x$
\item $x$ \emph{belongs to} $A$
\end{itemize}
\end{signature}

Basic Vocabulary \ref{sig:SetSignature} describes how we can talk about sets and elements, and how to use the notation of membership, but does not tell us that any sets actually exist. 
Our first remedy for this is to make room for finite sets.

\begin{principle}[Finite Sets] For any list $L  = [a_0,\ldots, a_{n-1}]$, there is a set, denoted by $\{a_0,\ldots,a_{n-1}\}$, so
  that $x\in \{a_0,\ldots, a_{n-1}\}$ if and only if $x=a_i$ for some
  $i<n$.  More precisely,
  \begin{itemize}
  \item $x\notin \{\}$ for any $x$ ($\{\}$ is said to be \emph{empty});
  \item $x\in \{a_0,\ldots,a_n\}$ if and only if $x=a_0$ or $x\in
    \{a_1,\ldots,a_n\}$.
  \end{itemize}
\end{principle}

\printbreak

\begin{example}
Here are some examples of sets built from finite lists:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\{\}$ -- an empty set;
\item $\{1,2,5\}$ -- a set consisting of three elements;
\item $\{\{\}\}$ -- a set consisting of one element, which is $\{\}$;
\item $\{1,2,4,\{1,2\}\}$ -- a set consisting of four elements, $1$,
  $2$, $4$ and the set $\{1,2\}$.
\item $\{4,5, \{\}, [\,]\}$ -- a set consisting of four elements. Note that
the set $\{\}$ and the list $[\,]$ are not the same things.
\item $\{1,2,3,4,3,2,1\}$ -- a set consisting of four elements, listing an element twice is redundant.
\item The sets $C$, $R$ and $S$ from the introduction.
\end{itemize}
\end{example}

The study of finite sets is surprisingly complex, and comprises a large part of
the branch of mathematics called \emph{combinatorics}. We will touch on some basics
of combinatorics later in the course. 

Various infinite sets of numbers also exist. Their existence follows from general principles
of set theory. 
We will not try to justify that explicitly.
For now, we can introduce them informally alon with the standard symbols we use to denotet them.

\begin{defn}
	The following sets are denoted by the special symbols:
	\begin{align*}
		\NN &= \text{the set of natural numbers}\\
		\ZZ &= \text{the set of integers}\\
		\QQ &= \text{the set of rational numbers}\\
		\RR &= \text{the set of real numbers}\\
		\CC &= \text{the set of complex numbers}
	\end{align*}
\end{defn}

\begin{exercises}
	\begin{enumerate}
  \item Let $A = \{1,\{2,3\},4\}$. Determine which of the following assertions are true.
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item $1\in A$
    \item $2\in A$
    \item $\{\}\in A$
    \item $\{2,3\}\in A$
    \item $A\in A$
    \end{enumerate}
  \item In the following examples of sets with elements following a pattern, write an expression for the same set
  that makes the pattern clearer.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item $\{0,2,4,\ldots, 100\}$
  \item $\{1,2,4,8,\ldots, 256\}$
  \item $\{0,1,3, 6, 10,\ldots, 55\}$
  \end{enumerate}
  \item $\bullet\in S$ (where $S$ is the finite set defined in the introduction).
  \end{enumerate}
\end{exercises}

\section{Subsets and Extensionality}

Sets are meant to be bare collections. 
For a set $A$, some things are in, some are not. 
That's all we can say.
Unlike a list, a set has no ``initial'' element.
For example, the set $\{1,2,3\}$ is the same as the set $\{2,3,1\}$, because both have the same elements. This is an important difference between
lists and sets: $[1,2,3]$ and $[2,3,1]$ are \emph{not} the same lists because order matters in lists. 
To make this precise, we need to be clear about when sets are equal. To help, we introduce an important definition.

\begin{defn}
  For sets $A$ and $B$, we say that \emph{$A$ is a subset of $B$} provided that every element of $A$ is an element of $B$. We 
  write this as $A\subseteq B$, and say that \emph{$A$ is included in $B$}.  We may also write $B\supseteq A$ 
  to mean the same thing, and say that \emph{$B$ is a superset of $A$}.

  If $A$ is \emph{not} a subset of $B$, we write $A\not\subseteq B$. If $A\subseteq B$ and $B\not\subseteq A$, then $A$ is called a
  \emph{proper subset of $B$}. To indicate that $A$ is a \emph{proper} subset of $B$, we may write $A\subsetneq B$. Some people write $A\subset B$ for this situation, but we will never use that symbol.
\end{defn}

Saying $A\subseteq B$ is exactly the same as saying that for any $x$, if $x\in A$ then $x\in B$. Suppose now $P$ is the set of all professors, and $H$ is the set of all human beings. Then $P\subseteq H$ is the (perhaps dubious) assertion that ``all professors are human beings''. 

\begin{example}
  Here are some examples and counter-examples of the subset relation.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item $\{1,2,3\}\subseteq \{0,1,2,3\}$
  \item $\{\}\subseteq \{0\}$
  \item $A\subseteq A$ for any set $A$ because, trivially, every
    element of $A$ is an element of $A$
  \item $\{\} \subseteq A$ for any set $A$ because every element of
    $\{\}$ (there are none) is an element of $A$
  \item $\{1,2,3\}\not\subseteq \{0,2,3\}$ because $1\in \{1,2,3\}$
    but $1\notin \{0,2,3\}$
  \item $\{1,2,3\}\subseteq \{2,3,1\}$
  \item $\{\spadesuit\} \subseteq S$
  \end{itemize}
\end{example}

\begin{exercises}
	For each of the following pairs of sets, determine whether or
  not the first is a subset of the second. Explain your answer.
  \begin{enumerate}[series=exercises]
  \item $\{0,1\}$ and $\{1,0\}$
  \item $\{a,b,c,d\}$ and $\{a,b,d,e,c\}$
  \item $\{\}$ and $\{\{\}\}$
  \item $\{0,3,6,10\}$ and $\{10,9,8,7,6,5,4,2,1, 0\}$
  \end{enumerate}
\end{exercises}

We can summarize two useful properties of $\subseteq$ as follows.
\begin{itemize}
	\item{}[Reflexivity]  For any set $A$, $A \subseteq A$. We say $\subseteq$ is \emph{reflexive}.
	\item{}[Transitivity] For any sets $A$, $B$ and $C$,
	if $A\subseteq B$ and $B\subseteq C$, then $A\subseteq C$. We say $\subseteq$ is \emph{transitive}.
\end{itemize}
Another familiar example of a reflexive, transitive
relation is $\leq$ on the natural numbers. In fact there are many examples of reflexive transitive relations throughout mathematics. 

The relation $\leq$ is also \emph{anti-symmetric}, meaning that if $m\leq n$ and $n\leq m$ then $m=n$. 
Suppose $A\subseteq B$ and $B\subseteq A$. Then, by definition $A$ and $B$ have the exact same elements.  By our understanding of sets as collections,
$A$ and $B$ must be equal. So we state this as another axiom.

\begin{principle}\label{ax:set-extensionality}
[\textbf{The Axiom of Set Extensionality}]
For sets $A$ and $B$, if $A\subseteq B$ and $B\subseteq A$, then $A=B$. In other words, $\subseteq$ is anti-symmetric.
\end{principle}

Based on this, we can already establish a useful fact: there is exactly one empty set. To set the tone for what follows, we make this a formal claim.

\begin{lemma}
	There is exactly one empty set.
\begin{proof}
	We have already noted that the set built from an empty list $\{\,\}$ has no elements. So there is at least one empty set.
	
	Suppose $E$ is a set with no elements.
	Then $E\subseteq \{\,\}$ because every element of $E$ (there are none) is an element of $\{\,\}$. 
	Similarly, $\{\,\}\subseteq E$ because every element of $\{\,\}$ (again, there are none) is an element of $E$. 
	So by Principle~\ref{ax:set-extensionality} $E = \{\,\}$.
\end{proof}
\end{lemma}

\begin{defn}
  The set $\{\}$ is also denoted by $\emptyset$.
\end{defn}

Set extensionality makes precise the idea that a set by itself does
not have any structure other than what members it possesses.
To emphasize this, sometimes it is useful to
depict a set with elements scattered about something like \usetikzlibrary{fit,shapes}
\[\begin{tikzpicture}[ >=stealth, bullet/.style={ fill=black, circle,
    minimum width=1pt, inner sep=2pt }, projection/.style={ ->, thick,
    shorten <=2pt, shorten >=2pt }, every fit/.style={ ellipse, draw,
    inner sep=2pt } ]
  \foreach \x/\y/\l in {0.4/1/d,-0.2/2/c/,0/3/b,0.5/4/a}
  \node[bullet,label=left:$\l$] (a\y) at (\y,\x) {};
  \node[draw,fit=(a1) (a2) (a3) (a4),minimum width=2cm] {} ;
\end{tikzpicture}
\]
with the elements scattered about. Evidently, a re-arrangement of the
elements does not change the depicted set. So
\[\usetikzlibrary{fit,shapes}
\begin{tikzpicture}[ >=stealth, bullet/.style={ fill=black, circle,
    minimum width=1pt, inner sep=2pt }, projection/.style={ ->, thick,
    shorten <=2pt, shorten >=2pt }, every fit/.style={ ellipse, draw,
    inner sep=2pt } ]
  \foreach \x/\y/\l in {0.3/2/d,-0.2/3/c/,0/4/b,-0.5/1/a}
  \node[bullet,label=left:$\l$] (a\y) at (\y,\x) {};
  \node[draw,fit=(a1) (a2) (a3) (a4),minimum width=2cm] {} ;

\end{tikzpicture}
\]
is the same set. Depicting a subset of a set is a simple
matter of drawing a smaller boundary around some of the elements as in the following.
\[\usetikzlibrary{fit,shapes}
\begin{tikzpicture}[ >=stealth, bullet/.style={ fill=black, circle,
    minimum width=1pt, inner sep=2pt }, projection/.style={ ->, thick,
    shorten <=2pt, shorten >=2pt }, every fit/.style={ ellipse, draw,
    inner sep=2pt } ]
  \foreach \x/\y/\l in {0.3/2/d,-0.2/3/c/,0/4/b,-0.5/1/a}
  \node[bullet,label=left:$\l$] (a\y) at (\y,\x) {};
  \node[draw,fit=(a1) (a2) (a3) (a4),minimum width=2cm] {} ;
  \node[draw, fit = (a2) (a3), minimum width=2cm] {};
\end{tikzpicture}
\]

\chapter{Functions}

\begin{goals}
\noindent\textbf{Lecture}
\begin{itemize}
\item Introduce basic structure of functions
\item Define the identity functions and function composition
\item Introduce internal diagrams of functions.
\end{itemize}

\noindent\textbf{Study}
\begin{itemize}
\item Be able to determine equality of functions
\item Use internal diagrams to depict function composition
\end{itemize}
\end{goals}

\emph{Functions} (perhaps in your calculus courses) are often talked about as \emph{operations}. 
For example, 
\[f(x) = x^2-1\]
can be seen as an operation that transforms a number $x$ into its square.
But it can also be seen as an attribute (the ``square of $x$'').
The ``operational'' view is informal, and often useful.
As we will see, though, it gets an important aspect of functions wrong because two entirely different operations may define the same function.

Informally, a function ``takes'' an argument from a given set as input and ``produces'' an output in a given set.
So the function $f$ defined by $f(x)=x^2 + 2x + 1$ might ``take'' the natural number $2$ and ``produce'' the natural number $10$. 
That is, $f(3)=3^2 + 1 = 10$. 
We begin by introducing the vocabulary of functions.

\begin{signature}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item For a set $A$ and a set $B$, there are things called \emph{functions from $A$ to $B$}, with a function $f$ from $A$ to $B$ being writing $\fromto fAB$ or $A\stackrel{f}{\to} B$. 

	\item For $\fromto fAB$, the set $A$ is called the \emph{domain} of $f$ and $B$ is called the \emph{codomain} of $f$.
	
	\item For any function $\fromto fAB$ and any element $a\in A$, $f$ and $a$ determine an element of $B$, written $f(a)$, and read ``$f$ of $a$''.
	\end{itemize}
\end{signature}

A functions may sometimes also be called a \emph{map}, a \emph{transformation}, or an \emph{operation}. 
As we will see, however, \emph{operation} is somewhat misleading, so we usually avoid it. 

Often, a function $\fromto fAB$ is \emph{defined} by a rule, just as they are in other parts of mathematics. 
We typically, write such rules by giving the function a name (very often $f$ because we are lazy) and spelling out the rule at the same time.
So we write things like
\[f(x)=x^2 + 4x + 2\]
to define a function $\fromto f\RR\RR$ (recall that $\RR$ is the set of real numbers).
But sometimes it is useful to have a rule without giving it a name.
To do that, we use the ``maps to'' arrow $\mapsto$.
So we might define the same function $f$ by saying that \emph{$f$ is given by the rule $x\mapsto x^2 + 4x + 2$}. 
We will not go so far as to write $f = (x\mapsto x^2+4x+2)$ because this more easily understood by writing $f(x)=x^2+4x+2$.
The rule $x\mapsto x^2  4x + 2$ is the same as the rule $y\mapsto y^2 + 4y + 2$. 
The variable only serves as a place holder, so its particular name does not matter.

There are two fundamental (trivial) types of rules that can be used to build functions.

\begin{principle}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item For any set $A$, there is a function $\fromto {\id_A}AA$ defined by the rule $x\mapsto x$.
		This is called the \emph{identity} function on $A$.
		\item For any two functions $\fromto fAB$ and $\fromto gBC$, there is a function $\fromto {g\circ f}AC$ defined by the rule $x\mapsto g(f(x))$.
		This is called the composition of $g$ and $f$ (or sometimes ``$g$ following $f$'').
	\end{itemize}
\end{principle}

Notice that $g\circ f$ is only defined when the \emph{domain} of $g$ matches the codomain of $f$.
Also, be careful about definitions like $f(x)=1/x$.
This does not define a function on the real numbers because $f(0)$ is undefined.
In other words, to be a function, $f$ must determine an element of the codomain for each and every element of the domain.

\begin{exercises}
	\begin{enumerate}[resume=exercises]
\item Suppose $\fromto fAB$, $\fromto gBC$ and $\fromto hCD$ are functions. Then $h\circ(g\circ f)$ and $(h\circ g)\circ f$ are functions
from $A$ to $D$. Do you think they are equal? Explain your answer in a few clearly written sentences.	
\end{enumerate}
\end{exercises}

\section{Internal Diagrams}

To depict a function on small sets, we can use the simple internal diagrams of the last section. For example,
\[
  \begin{tikzpicture}[
    >=stealth,
    bullet/.style={
      fill=black,
      circle,
      minimum width=1pt,
      inner sep=1pt
    },
    projection/.style={
      ->,
      thick,
      shorten <=2pt,
      shorten >=2pt
    },
    every fit/.style={
      ellipse,
      draw,
      inner sep=0pt
    }
  ]
    \foreach \x/\y/\l in {0.4/1/d,-0.2/2/c/,0/3/b,0.5/4/a}
      \node[bullet,label=left:$\l$] (a\y) at (\x,\y) {};

    \foreach \x/\y/\l in {4.1/1/4,3.2/2/3,4.3/3/2,4/4/1}
      \node[bullet,label=right:$\l$] (b\y) at (\x,\y) {};

    \node[draw,fit=(a1) (a2) (a3) (a4),minimum width=2cm] {} ;
    \node[draw,fit=(b1) (b2) (b3) (b4),minimum width=2cm] {} ;

    \draw[projection] (a1) -- (b4);
    \draw[projection] (a2) -- (b2);
    \draw[projection] (a3) -- (b1);
    \draw[projection] (a4) -- (b3);
  \end{tikzpicture}
\]
depicts a function from the set $\{a,b,c,d\}$ to the set $\{1,2,3,4\}$.

Composition can be illustrated using internal diagrams.
For example,
  \[
    \begin{tikzpicture}[
      >=stealth,
      bullet/.style={
        fill=black,
        circle,
        minimum width=1pt,
        inner sep=1pt
      },
      projection/.style={
        ->,
        thick,
        shorten <=2pt,
        shorten >=2pt
      },
      projectionC/.style={
        ->,
        thick,
        dashed,
        shorten <=2pt,
        shorten >=2pt
      },
      every fit/.style={
        ellipse,
        draw,
        inner sep=0pt
      }
    ]
      \foreach \x/\y/\l in {0.4/1/d,-0.2/2/c/,0/3/b,0.5/4/a}
        \node[bullet,label=left:$\l$] (a\y) at (\x,\y) {};

      \foreach \x/\y/\l in {3.5/2/4,4.1/3/3,3.2/4/2,4/5/1}
        \node[bullet,label=below:$\l$] (b\y) at (\x,\y) {};

      \foreach \x/\y/\l in {7.8/1/u,8.2/2/v,7.3/3/w,7.9/4/x, 8.0/5/z}
        \node[bullet,label=right:$\l$] (c\y) at (\x,\y) {};

      \node[blue] at (2,5) {$f$};
      \node[green] at (6,5.5) {$g$};
      \node[red] at (4,0.5) {$g\circ f$};

      \node[draw,fit=(a1) (a2) (a3) (a4),minimum width=2cm] {} ;
      \node[draw,fit=(b2) (b3) (b4) (b5),minimum width=2cm] {} ;
      \node[draw,fit=(c1) (c2) (c3) (c5),minimum width=2cm] {} ;

      \draw[projection,blue] (a1) -- (b2);
      \draw[projection,blue] (a2) -- (b2);
      \draw[projection,blue] (a3) -- (b3);
      \draw[projection,blue] (a4) -- (b5);
      \draw[projection,green] (b2) -- (c1);
      \draw[projection,green] (b3) -- (c2);
      \draw[projection,green] (b4) -- (c3);
      \draw[projection,green] (b5) -- (c5);

\section{Extensionality}

Just as for sets, we need a way to say when two functions are equal.
Let $\NN$ denote the set of natural numbers. 
Then define $\fromto f\NN\NN$ and $\fromto g\NN\NN$ by
\begin{align*}
f(n) &= n^2 +  2n + 1\\
g(n) &= (n+1)^2
\end{align*}
Evidently, for each $n\in\NN$, it is true that $f(n) = g(n)$.
So even though $f$ and $g$ are defined by different \emph{operations}, the two functions yield the same results.
As with sets, this leads to an axiom for equality of functions.

\begin{principle}[\textbf{The Axiom of Function Extensionality}]
	For functions $\fromto fAB$ and $\fromto gAB$, if it is the case that $f(x)=g(x)$ for all $x\in A$, then $f=g$.
	Note that equality of functions only makes sense when the two functions share the same domain and the same codomain.
\end{principle}

If we not concerned about the detailed internals of sets, but only with how functions interact, then a function can be depicted very simply as $A\stackrel{f}{\longrightarrow} B$.
So a composition of functions can be depicted as in
\[
\tikzset{>=stealth}
\begin{tikzpicture}[every node/.style={midway}]
\matrix[column sep={4em,between origins},
        row sep={2em}] at (0,0)
{ \node(A)   {$A$}  ; & \node(B) {$B$}; \\
                      & \node(C) {$C$}; \\};
\draw[->] (A) -- (B) node[anchor=south]  {$f$};
\draw[->] (B) -- (C) node[anchor=west]  {$g$};
\draw[->,red] (A) -- (C) node[anchor=north east] {$g\circ f$};
\end{tikzpicture}
\]
We do not really need to draw $g\circ f$ as a separate arrow because the \emph{path} from $A$ to $B$ to $C$ is already implicitly a depiction of $g\circ f$.
So the simpler diagram 
\[
\tikzset{>=stealth}
\begin{tikzpicture}[every node/.style={midway}]
\matrix[column sep={4em,between origins},
        row sep={2em}] at (0,0)
{ \node(A)   {$A$}  ; & \node(B) {$B$}; \\
                      & \node(C) {$C$}; \\};
\draw[->] (A) -- (B) node[anchor=south]  {$f$};
\draw[->] (B) -- (C) node[anchor=west]  {$g$};
\end{tikzpicture}
\]
shows the same information, namely, that $\fromto fAB$ and $\fromto gBC$ are functions and therefore, $\fromto {g\circ f}AC$ is too.

Now a diagram such as this
\[
\tikzset{>=stealth}
\begin{tikzpicture}[every node/.style={midway}]
\matrix[column sep={4em,between origins},
        row sep={2em}] at (0,0)
{ \node(A)   {$A$}  ; & \node(B) {$B$}; \\
  \node(D)   {$D$}  ; & \node(C) {$C$}; \\};
\draw[->] (A) -- (B) node[anchor=south]  {$f$};
\draw[->] (B) -- (C) node[anchor=west]  {$g$};
\draw[->] (A) -- (D) node[anchor=east] {$h$};
\draw[->] (D) -- (C) node[anchor=north] {$k$};
\end{tikzpicture}
\]
depicts two composite functions $g\circ f$ and $k\circ h$, but $g\circ f$ and $k\circ k$ may not be equal.
We say that the diagram \emph{commutes} or that it is a \emph{commutative diagram} if $g\circ f = k\circ h$.
In other words, saying that a certain diagram commutes \emph{is} an assertion that certain functions are equal.


\begin{exercises}
\begin{enumerate}
\item  For each of the following pairs of functions $\NN\to\NN$, determine whether they are equal and explain why or why not.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item $f(n) = 2n + 3$ and $g(m) = 2m + 3$
  \item $f(n) = 2^{n+1} - 1$ and $g(n) = \sum_{i=0}^n2^i$
  \item $f(n) =  n^2 + 5n + 6$ and $g(n) = (n+3)(n+2)$
  \item $f(n) = n^4 - 10n^3 + 35n^2 + 50n + 24$ and $g(n) = 24$
  \end{enumerate}
\item Let $\RR$ denote the set of all real numbers. Let $f(x) = \tan(x)$.
Explain why this does \emph{not} define a function from $\RR$ to $\RR$.
\item Suppose the following functions exist: $\fromto fAB$, $\fromto gBC$, $\fromto aAD$, $\fromto bCD$. 
  Draw a commutative diagram asserting that $b\circ g\circ f = a$.
\item Suppose the following functions exist: $\fromto fCA$, $\fromto gCB$, $\fromto hCP$, $\fromto pPA$ and $\fromto qPB$.
 Draw a commutative diagram asserting that $f=p\circ h$ and $g=q\circ h$.
\end{enumerate}

\end{goals}

So far, we have thought mainly about informally defined sets and functions.
To fill out our understanding of sets, we need to be able to build sets for specific purposes and with specific structure in mind. 

Three finite sets will play particularly important roles.
We have already discussed the set $\emptyset$, consisting of no elements.
We also need a designated set with one element and a designated set with two elements.
We denote these by $\One$ and $\Two$. 
It does not matter at all \emph{what} elements are in these because, as we will soon see, any two sets of the same size are interchangeable.
What `interchangeable' means is discussed later.
What `same size' means is obvious for finite sets.
We discuss the general situation later as well.

For the time being, we merely need to agree on a fixed set with one element and a fixed set with two elements.
The particular choices we make here will be clearer as we put them to use.

\begin{defn}
	Let $\bullet$, $\bot$ and $\top$ be fixed symbols. Then define
	\begin{align*}
		\One &= \{\bullet\}\\
		\Two &= \{\bot,\top\}
	\end{align*} 
	The single element of $\One$ is intended to look like a generic point in an internal diagram.
	The element $\top$ is meant to remind you of the letter `T' (short for `True') and $\bot$ is meant to be the opposite of $\top$ (that is, 'False').
\end{defn}

As mentioned above, the particular choice of elements is not important.
Some folks would define $\One$ to be $\{0\}$ and $\Two$ to be $\{0,1\}$.
This is convenient because the pattern continues: $\mathcal{3}$ would $\{0,1,2\}$, and so on.
We, however, wish to emphasize other things that have nothing directly to do with the numbers $0$ and $1$ (as members of $\One$ and $\Two$).

\section{Elements, Pointers and Constant Functions}

Suppose we are told that $\fromto p\One A$ is a function.
Since $\bullet\in\One$, this function determines an element of $A$, namely $p(\bullet)$.
A picture of the situation might be this:
\[
  \begin{tikzpicture}[
    >=stealth,
    bullet/.style={
      fill=black,
      circle,
      minimum width=1pt,
      inner sep=1pt
    },
    projection/.style={
      ->,
      thick,
      shorten <=2pt,
      shorten >=2pt
    },
    every fit/.style={
      ellipse,
      draw,
      inner sep=0pt
    }
  ]
    \node[bullet] (p) at (0,2.5) {};

    \foreach \x/\y/\l in {4.1/1/4,3.2/2/3,4.3/3/2,4/4/1}
      \node[bullet,label=right:$\l$] (a\y) at (\x,\y) {};

    \node[draw,fit=(p),minimum width=1cm, minimum height=1cm] {} ;
    \node[draw,fit=(a1) (a2) (a3) (a4),minimum width=2cm] {} ;

    \draw[projection] (p) -- (a3);
  \end{tikzpicture}
\]
Since $\One$ has only a single element, it can ``point'' only to a single element of $A$.
So we might refer to a function $\One\to A$ as a \emph{pointer} into $A$.
Each pointer determines an element of $A$. 
And conversely, it should be possible to point to any element of $A$. 
This leads to our first principle guaranteeing that certain (nearly trivial) functions exist.

\begin{principle}\label{ax:pointers}
	For any set $A$, and any $a\in A$, there is a function $\fromto {\hat a}\One A$ given by the rule $x\mapsto = a$.
\end{principle}

Thus the function depicted above is $\hat{2}$. 
In effect, this principle simply asserts that elements of a set $A$ and functions $\One\to A$ are interchangible: from $a\in A$ we get $\fromto {\hat{a}}\One A$; from $\fromto p\One A$.
we get the element $p(\bullet)$.

This principle also justifies the drawing of internal diagrams for pointers, like the one above, because it means that any such diagram is guaranteed to depict an actual function. 

Suppose $\fromto fA\One$ and $\fromto gA\One$ are functions, that is, their \emph{codomain} is $\One$ instead their \emph{domain}. 
Then $f(a)=g(a)$ is true for every $a\in A$ because $\bullet$ is the only possible value: $f(a) = \bullet = g(a)$. 
So $f=g$ by the Principle of Function Extensionality.
In other words, there is at most one function from $A$ to $\One$.
But the rule $x\mapsto \bullet$ is as simple a rule as one can imagine. 
This leads to another definition and another principle.

\begin{defn}\label{def:terminal}
	A set $T$ is \emph{terminal} if it is the case that for any set $A$ there is exactly one function from $A$ to $T$.
\end{defn}

\begin{principle}
	The set $\One$ is a terminal set. 
	We denote the unique function from $A$ to $\One$ by $\fromto {\Diamond_A}{A}\One$.
	
	The rule defining $\Diamond_A$ must be
	\[x\mapsto\bullet.\]
\end{principle}

Using $\Diamond_A$ and $\hat{b}$ for an element $b\in B$, we can now define a constant function. 
That is $\hat{b}\circ\Diamond_A$ is a function from $A$ to $B$ given by the rule
$x\mapsto \hat{b}(\Diamond_A(x))$. But since $\hat{b}(\Diamond_A(x))= \hat{b}(\bullet) = b$, the rule simplifies to $x\mapsto b$. 
In short, this is the function sending any element of $A$ to the constant $b$. 

\begin{exercises}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Show that for any pointer $\fromto p\One A$, it is the case that $\widehat{p(\bullet)}=p$.
		\item Show that any set with exactly one element is a terminal set.
		\item Suppose that $\fromto fAB$ is a function. Show that for every $a\in A$, $\widehat{f(a)} = f\circ \hat{a}$.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{exercises}

\section{The Empty Set}

For trivial reasons, there is at most one function from $\emptyset$ to $A$,
for any set $A$. That is,  if $\fromto {f,g}\emptyset A$ are functions, then
for each $x\in\emptyset$, $f(x)=g(x)$ because there are no $x$'s to concern us. Hence by Principle \ref{ax:FunctionExtensionality}, $f=g$. The empty ``rule'' that tells us to do nothing actually specifies a function from $\emptyset$ to $A$. So for any set $A$, there is exactly one function from $\emptyset$ to $A$. Let's make that official.

\begin{defn}
	An \emph{initial set} is a set $I$ so that for any set $A$, there is exactly one function from $I$ to $A$.
\end{defn}

\begin{principle}
	The emptyset $\emptyset$ is an initial set. For a set $A$, the unique
	function from $\emptyset$ to $A$ (given by the empty rule) may be denoted by 
	$\fromto {\Box_A}\emptyset A$.
\end{principle}

Notice that a function $A\to\emptyset$ is impossible unless $A$ is also empty.
So $\emptyset$ is the only initial set. 

\begin{exercises}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item How many functions are there from $\emptyset$ to $\{a,b,c,d\}$? Explain.
		\item How many functions are there from $\{a,b,c,d\}$ to $emptyset$? Explain.
		\item How many functions are there from $\One$ to $\{a,b,c,d\}$? Explain.
		\item How many functions are there from $\{a,b,c,d\}$ to $\One$? Explain.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{exercises}

\section{Solution Sets, Subsets, Characteristic Functions}

Suppose we are given two functions that are ``parallel'': $\fromto fAB$ and $\fromto gAB$. 
To aid readability, we will write this as $A\doublerightarrow{f}{g}B$.
For some values $a\in A$, it might be the case that $f(a)=g(a)$.
We may call such a value a \emph{particular solution to the equation $f(x)=g(x)$}. 

It might be the case that there are no particular solutions to an equation $f(x)=g(x)$.
For example, there are no natural numbers $n$ such that $n+1 = n$. 
On the other hand, there might be many particular solutions. 
For example, let $f(x)=x^3$ and let $g(x)= 6x^2 - 11x + 6$ both regarded as functions on the natural numbers.
Then it is easy to check that $1$, $2$ and $3$ solve the equation $f(x)=g(x)$.
In fact, these three are the only particular solutions.
We generalize as follows.

\begin{defn}\label{def:equalizer} 
	For two functions $A\doublerightarrow{f}{g} B$, a \emph{general solution} is a function $\fromto sCA$ so that 
	\[f\circ s = g\circ s.\]
	Thus for example, if $a\in A$ is a particular solution then the pointer $\hat a$ is a general solution.

	For functions $A\doublerightarrow{f}{g} B$, an \emph{equalizer} is general solution $\fromto eEA$ so that for any general solution $\fromto sCA$, there is exactly one function $\fromto hCE$ so that \[e\circ h = k.\]
\end{defn}

\begin{principle}
	For functions $A\doublerightarrow{f}{g} B$, the collection of all particular solutions to the equation $f(x)=g(x)$ form a set, denoted by $\{x\in A\st f(x) = g(x)\}$. 	
	The function $\fromto i{\{x\in A\st f(x)=g(x)\}}A$ given by the rule $x\mapsto x$ (called an \emph{inclusion map}) is an equalizer for $f$ and $g$.
	
	If $\fromto sCA$ is a general solution of  $f(x)=g(x)$, that is, $f\circ s = g\circ s$,
	then the function $\fromto {\check s}C{\{x\in A\st f(x)=g(x)\}}$ given by the rule 
	\[x\mapsto s(x)\]
	is the unique function for which $s = i\circ \check s$. 
\end{principle}

This axiom tells us three main things.
First, we can form a subset of $A$ by specifying an equation $f(x)=g(x)$ for any two functions $A\doublerightarrow{f}{g}B$, and picking out the particular solutions.
Second, a subset formed in this way ``embeds'' in the given set $A$ by its inclusion map $i$.
Third, for any solution $s$, the function into the set of particular solutions is defined by the same rule as $s$.

External diagrams help us understand equalizers. A general solution of $X\doublerightarrow{f}{g}Y$ can be depicted by saying that the following diagram commutes 

\[
\begin{tikzpicture}
\matrix (m) [row sep=3em,column sep=4em,minimum width=2em]
{
	\node (A) {$A$}; & \node (B) {$B$};\\
};
\draw[->] (A.10) -- node[anchor=south]  {$f$} (B.170) ;
\draw[->] (A.350) -- node[anchor=north]  {$g$} (B.190);
\end{tikzpicture}
\]

Then an equalizer is a general solution
\[
\begin{tikzpicture}
\matrix (m) [row sep=3em,column sep=4em,minimum width=2em]
{
	\node (E) {$E$}; & \node (A) {$A$}; & \node (B) {$B$};\\
};
\draw[->, green] (E.east) -- node[anchor=north] {$e$} (A.west); 
\draw[->] (A.10) -- node[anchor=south]  {$f$} (B.170) ;
\draw[->] (A.350) -- node[anchor=north]  {$g$} (B.190);
\end{tikzpicture}
\]
so that if 
\[
\begin{tikzpicture}
\matrix (m) [row sep=3em,column sep=4em,minimum width=2em]
{
	\node (S) {$S$};\\
	\node (E) {$E$}; & \node (A) {$A$}; & \node (B) {$B$};\\
};
\draw[->, red] (S.south east) -- node[anchor=south] {$s$} (A.north west);
\draw[->, blue] (E.east) -- node[anchor=north] {$e$} (A.west); 
\draw[->] (A.10) -- node[anchor=south]  {$f$} (B.170) ;
\draw[->] (A.350) -- node[anchor=north]  {$g$} (B.190);
\end{tikzpicture}
\]
also commutes (that is, $\fromto sSA$ is a general solution), then there is exactly one function making
\[
\begin{tikzpicture}
\matrix (m) [row sep=3em,column sep=4em,minimum width=2em]
{
	\node (S) {$S$};\\
	\node (E) {$E$}; & \node (A) {$A$}; & \node (B) {$B$};\\
};
\draw[->,ForestGreen] (S.south) -- node[anchor=east] {$\check s$} (E.north);
\draw[->, red] (S.south east) -- node[anchor=south] {$s$} (A.north west);
\draw[->, blue] (E.east) -- node[anchor=north] {$e$} (A.west); 
\draw[->] (A.10) -- node[anchor=south]  {$f$} (B.170) ;
\draw[->] (A.350) -- node[anchor=north]  {$g$} (B.190);
\end{tikzpicture}
\]
commute.

Suppose $c\in C$ and $\fromto fAC$ is a function, then we can form the equalizer of $f$ and the constant function $\hat{c}\circ\Diamond_A$.
This is more easily written we $\{x\in A\st f(x)=c\}$.
Since it common to pick out sets like this, special notation is in order.

\begin{defn}\label{def:inverse-image}
	For a function $\fromto fAC$, and a value $c\in C$, 
	\[f^-(c) = \{x\in A\st f(x)=c\}.\] 
	In this case, $f^-(c)$ is called the \emph{inverse image of $c$ with respect to $f$}.
\end{defn}

A diagram can help understand inverse images. Suppose $\fromto fAC$ and $c\in C$,
then we can arrange a diagram 

\[
\begin{tikzpicture}
\matrix (m) [row sep=3em,column sep=4em,minimum width=2em]
{
	& \node (one) {$\One$};\\
	\node (A) {$A$}; & \node (C) {$C$};\\
};
\draw[->] (A.east) -- node[anchor=north]  {$f$} (C.west) ;
\draw[->] (one.south) -- node[anchor=east]  {$\hat c$} (C.north);
\end{tikzpicture}
\]
The inverse image is a subset of $A$ with an inclusion map that makes the following diagram commute:
\[
\begin{tikzpicture}
\matrix (m) [row sep=3em,column sep=4em,minimum width=2em]
{
	\node (inv) {$f^-(c)$}; & \node (one) {$\One$};\\
	\node (A) {$A$}; & \node (C) {$C$};\\
};
\draw[->] (A.east) -- node[anchor=north]  {$f$} (C.west) ;
\draw[->] (one.south) -- node[anchor=west]  {$\hat c$} (C.north);
\draw[->,blue] (inv.south) -- node[anchor=east] {$i$} (A.north);
\draw[->,blue] (inv.east) -- node[anchor=north] {$\Diamond_{f^-(c)}$} (one.west);
\end{tikzpicture}
\]
For any other functions that make following diagram commute:
\[
\begin{tikzpicture}
\matrix (m) [row sep=3em,column sep=4em,minimum width=2em]
{
	\node (B) {$B$};\\
	&\node (inv) {$f^-(c)$}; & \node (one) {$\One$};\\
	&\node (A) {$A$}; & \node (C) {$C$};\\
};
\draw[->] (A.east) -- node[anchor=north]  {$f$} (C.west) ;
\draw[->] (one.south) -- node[anchor=west]  {$\hat c$} (C.north);
\draw[->,blue] (inv.south) -- node[anchor=east] {$i$} (A.north);
\draw[->,blue] (inv.east) -- node[anchor=north] {$\Diamond_{f^-(c)}$} (one.west);
\draw[->,red] (B.south) -- node[anchor=east] {$g$} (A.north west);
\draw[->,red] (B.east) -- node[anchor=south] {$\Diamond_B$} (one.north west);
\end{tikzpicture}
\]
there is a unique function $\fromto {\check g}B{f^-(c)}$ making
\[
\begin{tikzpicture}
\matrix (m) [row sep=3em,column sep=4em,minimum width=2em]
{
	\node (B) {$B$};\\
	&\node (inv) {$f^-(c)$}; & \node (one) {$\One$};\\
	&\node (A) {$A$}; & \node (C) {$C$};\\
};
\draw[->] (A.east) -- node[anchor=north]  {$f$} (C.west) ;
\draw[->] (one.south) -- node[anchor=west]  {$\hat c$} (C.north);
\draw[->,blue] (inv.south) -- node[anchor=east] {$i$} (A.north);
\draw[->,blue] (inv.east) -- node[anchor=north] {$\Diamond_{f^-(c)}$} (one.west);
\draw[->,red] (B.south) -- node[anchor=east] {$g$} (A.north west);

\draw[->, ForestGreen] (B.south east) -- node[anchor=west] {$\check g$} (inv.north west);
\end{tikzpicture}
\]
commute.


In Definition \ref{def:inverse-image}, the set $f^-(c)$ is a subset of $A$.
It would be good to know that any subset of $A$ can be described as an inverse image.
This is where the set $\Two$ plays a role.

\begin{defn}\label{def:subset-classifier}
	A \emph{subset classifier} is a set $S$ with a distinguished element $t\in S$ so that for any set $A$ and any subset $B\subseteq A$, there is exactly one function $\fromto kAT$ for which $B = k^-(t)$.
	That is, $B$ is uniquely defined as the inverse image of $t$ with respect to a function into $S$.
\end{defn}

\begin{principle}\label{ax:subset-char}
	The set $\Two$ with the distinguished element $\top$ is a subset classifier.
	For subset $B\subseteq A$, the function corresponding to $B$, called the \emph{characteristic function of $B$}, is denoted by $\kappa_B$.
	In other words, $\kappa_B$ is the unique function for which $B = \kappa_B^-(\top)$.

	For $B\subseteq A$, the characteristic function is defined by the rule
	\[
	x \mapsto
		\begin{cases}
			\top &\text{ if } x\in B\\
			\bot &\text{ otherwise}
		\end{cases}
	\]
\end{principle}

Just as Principle \ref{ax:pointers} asserts that elements of $A$ and functions $\One\to A$ are interchangeable, Principle \ref{ax:subset-char} asserts that the subsets of $A$ and the functions $A\to\Two$ are interchangeable.
   

\begin{exercises}
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item Draw a depiction of $A=\{a,b,c,d,e,f,g\}$ and its subset $B=\{a,c,e,g\}$ in the same internal diagram. Now depict the characteristic map for $B$ as a subset of $A$.
	
	\item Define two functions $\NN\doublerightarrow{f}{g}\NN$ so that the set of particular solutions fo $f(x)=g(x)$ is $\{1,5\}$. 
	
	\item Consider the functions $\fromto f\RR\RR$ defined by $f(x) = \sin(x) + \cos(x)$, and $\fromto s\NN\RR$ defined by $s(n) = 2\pi n^2$. 
	Is $s$ a solution for the equation $f(x) = -1$? 
	What is the set of all particular solutions?
	
	\item Describe what a subset classifier is, using diagrams similar to the diagrams we have used to describe equalizers and inverse images.
	That is, for a start, we have a diagram
	\[
		\begin{tikzpicture}
	\matrix (m) [row sep=3em,column sep=4em,minimum width=2em]
	{
		\node (one) {$\One$};\\
		\node (S) {$S$};\\
	};
	\draw[->] (one.south) -- node[anchor=west]  {$\hat t$} (S.north);
	\end{tikzpicture}
	\]
	Now suppose we are given a subset $A\subseteq X$ with its inclusion map:
		\[
		\begin{tikzpicture}
		\matrix (m) [row sep=3em,column sep=4em,minimum width=2em]
		{
			\node (A) {$A$}; & \node (one) {$\One$};\\
			\node (X) {$X$}; & \node (S) {$S$};\\
		};
		\draw[->] (A.east) -- node[anchor=south] {$\Diamond_A$} (one.west);
		\draw[->] (A.south) -- node[anchor=east]  {$i$} (X.north);
		\draw[->] (one.south) -- node[anchor=west]  {$\hat t$} (S.north);
		\end{tikzpicture}
		\]
	What additional function is required to exist? What properties is it required to have? [Hint: the result should be that $A$ is an inverse image.]
	\end{enumerate}
		
\end{exercises}

\section{Product Sets and Functions of Two Arguments}

We should be able to deal with functions of more than one argument, such as a function $f(x,y) = x+y$.
To account for these, we take our cue from Descartes.

Descartes studied the geometric plane in terms of a coordinate system consisting of the so-called $x$-axis and $y$-axis (what we call cartesian coordinates in his honor).
Once we have decided where to place the axes (as long as they do not run in parallel), a pair such as $(2,3)$ determines a point on the plane, and any point $p$ in the plane determines a pair.
So Descartes realized that we might as well just say that the plane actually \emph{is} the collection of all pairs of real numbers.
What makes this work is that points in the plane \emph{project} onto the two axes in a universal way.
Products of sets generalize this idea.

\begin{defn}
For sets $A$ and $B$, a \emph{table} consists of two functions $A\stackrel{f}{\longleftarrow} C\stackrel{g}{\longrightarrow}B$.
Note that the two functions have the same domain. We may call the two functions \emph{legs} of the table.

For sets $A$ and $B$, a \emph{product of $A$ and $B$} is a table $A\stackrel{p}{\longleftarrow} P\stackrel{q}{\longrightarrow}B$ so that for any table $A\stackrel{f}{\longleftarrow} C\stackrel{g}{\longrightarrow}B$ there is exactly one function $\fromto hCP$ for which $f = p\circ h$ and $g= q\circ h$. 
For a product, the legs $p$ and $q$ are called the \emph{projections}.
\end{defn}

\begin{principle}\label{ax:products}
	For sets $A$ and $B$, the collection of all pairs $(a,b)$ where $a\in A$ and $b\in B$ is a set, denoted by $A\times B$. 
	The functions $A\stackrel{\pi_0}{\longleftarrow}{A\times B}\stackrel{\pi_1}{\longrightarrow}B$ given by the rules $(a,b)\mapsto a$
	and $(a,b)\mapsto b$ are projections. For $A\stackrel{f}{\longleftarrow}{C}\stackrel{g}{\longrightarrow}B$, the unique function required by
	the product may be denoted by $\langle f,g\rangle$.

	For $A\stackrel{f}{\longleftarrow}{C}\stackrel{g}{\longrightarrow}B$, the function $\fromto {\langle f,g\rangle}C{A\times B}$ is defined by the rule $\langle f,g\rangle(x)=(f(x),g(x))$.
\end{principle}

As with equalizers and inversee images, products can be described in terms of diagrams.

A product of $A$ and $B$ is depicted as a diagram
	\[
	\begin{tikzpicture}
	\matrix (m) [row sep=3em,column sep=4em,minimum width=2em]
	{
		\node (A) {$A$}; & \node (P) {$P$}; & \node (B) {$B$};\\
	};
	\draw[->, blue] (P.west) -- node[anchor=north] {p} (A.east);
	\draw[->, blue] (P.east) -- node[anchor=north] {q} (B.west);
	\end{tikzpicture}
	\]
so that for any other table over $A$ and $B$:
	\[
	\begin{tikzpicture}
	\matrix (m) [row sep=3em,column sep=4em,minimum width=2em]
	{
		&\node (C) {$C$};\\
		\node (A) {$A$}; & \node (P) {$P$}; & \node (B) {$B$};\\
	};
	\draw[->,red] (C.south west) -- node[anchor=south east] {$f$} (A.north east);
	\draw[->,red] (C.south east) -- node[anchor=south west] {$g$} (B.north west);
	\draw[->,blue] (P.west) -- node[anchor=north] {$p$} (A.east);
	\draw[->,blue] (P.east) -- node[anchor=north] {$q$} (B.west);
	\end{tikzpicture},
	\]
there is a unique function making 
	\[
	\begin{tikzpicture}
	\matrix (m) [row sep=3em,column sep=4em,minimum width=2em]
	{
		&\node (C) {$C$};\\
		\node (A) {$A$}; & \node (P) {$P$}; & \node (B) {$B$};\\
	};
	\draw[->,ForestGreen] (C.south) -- node[anchor=north east] {$\langle f,g\rangle$} (P.north);
	\draw[->,red] (C.south west) -- node[anchor=south east] {$f$} (A.north east);
	\draw[->,red] (C.south east) -- node[anchor=south west] {$g$} (B.north west);
	\draw[->,blue] (P.west) -- node[anchor=north] {$p$} (A.east);
	\draw[->,blue] (P.east) -- node[anchor=north] {$q$} (B.west);
	\end{tikzpicture},
	\]
commute.		

Suppose we are given two unrelated functions $\fromto fAB$ and $\fromto gCD$. 
We can now form a single function from $A\times C$ to $B\times D$ by combining $f$ and $g$ ``independently''. 
That is, define $f\times g = \langle f\circ \pi_0,g\circ \pi_1\rangle$.
Calculating concretely in terms of elements $(f\times g)(x,y) = (f(x),g(y))$. 
So $f\times g$ acts on a pair $(x,y)$ by applying $f$ to $x$ and unrelatedly applying $g$ to $y$. 

Products can by generalized to three, four or more sets.
For example, given sets $A$, $B$ and $C$, we might write $A\times B\times C$ for the set of triples $(a,b,c)$ where $a\in A$, $b\in B$ and $c\in C$. 
Instead of two projections, this would have three projections $(x,y,z)\mapsto x$, and so on. 
It turns out, however, that binary products are enough because $A\times (B\times C)$ behaves just like $A\times B\times C$.

\begin{exercises}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item For the sets $A = \{a,b,c\}$ and $B = \{1,2,3,4\}$, calculate $A\times B$ and $B\times A$
		\item What is $\emptyset \times A$? 
		\item Calculate $\{4,a,0\}\times \Two$.
		\item Describe in plain English what are the elements of $\NN\times \NN$.
		\item Suppose $A$ is a finite set with $m$ elements and $B$ is a finite set with $n$ elements.
		How many elements are in $A\times B$?
		\item Describe in plain English why it makes sense to refer to $A\times B$ as a ``product.''
		\item For sets $A=\{a,b\}$, $B=\{0,1,2\}$ and $C=\{c,d\}$, calculate $A\times B\times C$, $A\times (B\times C)$ and $(A\times B)\times C$.
		\item Describe the standard fifty-two card poker deck as a product of two sets.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{exercises}

\section{Function Sets}

A function from $A$ to $B$ might depend on a parameter from $C$. 
For example, the function $\fromto f\RR\RR$ defined by the rule $f(x) = \sin(x + c)$ depends on the constant $c$.
There is a related function $\fromto g{\RR\times \RR}\RR$ defined by $g(c,x) = \sin(x+c)$.
Evidently, $g$ describes the same behavior as $f$, but it makes the parameter explicit. It will be helpful to relate $g$ -- a function on pairs -- to $f$ a function with a parameter.
This leads to the following definition.

\begin{defn}
	For sets $A$ and $B$, a \emph{parametric function from $A$ to $B$} is a function $\fromto g{C\times A}B$ for some set $C$.
	The set $C$ may be called the \emph{set of parameters}.
	
	Suppose $\fromto f{D\times A}B$ is a parametric function with parameter set $D$ and $\fromto kCD$ is a function.
	Then we can form another parametric function with parameters in $C$ by composition: $f\circ (k\times \id_A)$.
	We may refer to $k$ as a \emph{change of parameters} function because $k$ transforms the parametric function with parameters in $D$ into a parametric function with parameters in $C$. 
	Specifically, $f\circ(k\times \id_A)$ is given by the rule $(c,a)\mapsto f(k(c),a)$. 
	
	An \emph{evaluation map} for $A$ and $B$ is a parametric function $\fromto a{F\times A}B$, so that for any 
	parametric function $\fromto g{C\times A}B$ there is exactly one change of parameters $\fromto hCF$ so that
	$g = a\circ (h\times \id_A)$. In that case, $F$ is called an \emph{exponential with base $B$ and exponent $A$}.
\end{defn}

\begin{principle}
	For sets $A$ and $B$, the collection of all functions from $A$ to $B$, denoted by $B^A$, is a set.
	
	The rule $(f,x) \mapsto f(x)$ defines an evaluation map $\fromto \appl{B^A\times A}B$.
	
	For a parametric function $\fromto f{C\times A}B$, the unique function from $C$ to $B^A$ determined by $f$ does not have a completely standard name.
	Increasingly, mathematicians honor the twentieth century logician, Haskell Curry, by referring to this as `currying'.
	For these lectures, we follow that tradition and write $\curry[f]$ for the unique function satisfying $f = \appl\circ (\curry[f] \times \id_A)$.
	
	Calculating how $\fromto {\curry[f]}C{B^A}$ must behave, we see that $\curry[f](c)$ is the function from $A$ to $B$ given by the rule $x\mapsto f(c,x)$.
	So for any $c\in C$, $\curry[f](c)$ is the function such that for any $a\in A$, $\curry[f](c)(a) = f(c,a)$. 
\end{principle}

\subsection*{$\lambda$ Notation}

When we describe a function by a rule like $x\mapsto x^2$, it is usually convenient to give the function a name.
So we might write $f(x) = x^2$ (lazily, because $f$ is vastly over-used).
But when we need to define an element of $B^A$, it is often convenient to have a notation that does not require a name. 
The logician Alonzo Church \cite{church} proposed a notation to describe functions. 
He wrote things like $\lambda x.x^2$ to describe the function that squares its input. 
The Greek letter $\lambda$ is used only as a marker to introduce a function. 
It does not mean anything special. 
We could make the $\lambda$ notation formal (as did Church), but for our purposes we do not need to be too formal.

\begin{example}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item For $\fromto fAB$ and $\fromto gBC$, the composite function $g\circ f$ is $\lambda x.g(f(x))$.
	
	\item For $A\stackrel{f}{\longleftarrow}C\stackrel{g}{\longrightarrow}B$, the function
	$\fromto {\langle f,g\rangle}C{A\times B}$ is $\lambda x.(f(x),g(x))$.
	
	\item For a parametric function $\fromto f{C\times A}B$, the function $\fromto {\curry[f]}{C}{B^A}$ can be defined by the rule $c\mapsto \lambda x.f(c,x)$.
	\end{itemize}
\end{example}
 

\begin{exercises}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item  For set $A= \{1,2,3\}$ and $B = \{a,b\}$ 
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item draw internal diagrams corresponding to each element of $B^A$ (there are eight of them);
				\item draw internal diagrams corresponding to each element of $A^B$ (there are nine of them).
			\end{enumerate}
		\item If $A$ is a finite set with $k$ elements, $B$ is a finite set with $j$ elements, how many elements are there in the set $B^A$. 
		\item Consider the function $\fromto f{\NN\times\NN}\NN$ defined by
		      $f(m,n) = m^n$. What function is $\curry[f](3)$? Use $\lambda$ notation to describe it.
		\item Use $\lambda$ notation to describe a function from $\NN$ to $\NN$ that quadruples the square of the input.
	\end{enumerate}	
\end{exercises}

%An equalizer ($\{x\in A\st f(x)=g(x)\}$), a terminal object ($\One$) and an exponential ($B^A$) are also characterized by some special functions so that any similarly arranged functions determine a unique function making a suitable diagram commute.

%They are called \emph{universal constructions}.
%So the inclusion $\{x\in A\st f(x)=g(x)\}\to A$ is universal for solving the equation $f=g$; $A\stackrel{\pi_0}{\longleftarrow}A\times B\stackrel{\pi_1}{\longrightarrow}B$ is universal for mapping into $A$ and $B$;

\section{Relations and Function Graphs}

We have already noted that a charcteristic function $\fromto R{X\times Y}\Two$ corresponds to a subset of $X\times Y$. We can think of $R$ \emph{relating} elements of $X$ to elements of $Y$. This leads to a useful definition.

\begin{defn}
	A \emph{relation from $X$ to $Y$} is subset $R\subseteq X\times Y$.
	A \emph{relation on $X$} is a relation from $X$ to $X$.
	
	For a relation $R$ from $X$ to $Y$, we will say ``$x$ is $R$-related to $y$'' and write $R(x,y)$ when $(x,y)\in R$. In some situations, we may use ``infix'' notation, writing $x\mathrel{R}y$ instead of $R(x,y)$.
	
	A relation $R\subseteq {X\times Y}$ is
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \emph{total} if for every $x\in X$, there is at least one $y\in Y$ for which $x\mathrel{R}y$;
		\item \emph{deterministic} if for every $x\in X$, there is at most one $y\in Y$ for which $x\mathrel{R}y$;
		\item \emph{functional} if it is total and deterministic.
	\end{itemize}
\end{defn}

\begin{example}
	The relation of $\leq$ on real numbers can be regarded as subset $\mathord{\leq}\subseteq {\RR\times\RR}$ defined by $(x,y) \in \mathord\leq$ when $x$ is actually less than or equal to $y$ and $(x,y)\in \mathord\leq$ otherwise. 
	This is a good example of why we prefer to write $x\leq y$ instead of $\mathord\leq(x,y)$ or $(x,y)\in \mathord\leq(x,y)$. Note that $\leq$ is a total relation, because for any $x\in \RR$ there is a $y\in \RR$ for which $x\leq y$.

	The relation $=$ on any set is functional because, for any $x\in X$ there is exactly one $y\in X$ so that $x=y$.
	
	Define the relation $S$ on $\RR$ by $x\mathrel{S}y$ if and only if $x = y^2$. 
	Then $S$ is not deterministic because $1\mathrel{S}1$ and $1\mathrel{S}-1$.
	It is not total because there is no $y$ for which $-1\mathrel{S}y$.
\end{example}

\begin{defn}
A function $\fromto fXY$ determines a relation called the \emph{graph of $f$} defined by 
\[\text{$(x,y)\in \Gamma_f(x,y)$ if and only if $f(x)=y$}.
\]

[Note: $\Gamma_f = \{(x,y)\in X\times Y\st f(x)=y\}$. So it is an equalizer $\{p\in X\times Y\st f(\pi_0(p)) = \pi_1(p)\}$]
\end{defn}

\begin{lemma}
	For any function $\fromto fYX$, the graph $\Gamma_f$ is functional.
	
	\begin{proof}
		This is pretty obvious from the basic properties of functions. That is,
		for each $x\in X$, $f(x)\in Y$ and obviously $f(x)=f(x)$. So $\Gamma_f$ is total. On the other hand if $y = f(x)$ and $y'=f(x)$, then $y=y'$. So $\Gamma_f$ is deterministic.
	\end{proof}
\end{lemma}

Suppose we have a functional relation $R\subseteq {X\times Y}$. Then it is reasonable to suppose it actually came from a function.

\begin{principle}\label{princ:graphs}
	Suppose $R\subseteq {X\times Y}$ is a functional relation. 
	Then there is a function $\fromto {F_R}XY$ so that $\Gamma_{F_R} = R$.
\end{principle}

It is easy enough to check that $F_{\Gamma_f} = f$ for any function $f$. 
That is, $F_{\Gamma_f}(x)=y$ if and only if $x\mathrel{\Gamma_f} y$ if and only if $f(x)=y$. 
So functions from $\fromto fXY$ correspond exactly to functional relations from $R\subseteq X\times Y$.

\begin{exercises}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Define $T\subseteq \RR\times \RR$ by $x\mathrel{T} y$ if and only if $\tan x = y$. Is $T$ deterministic? Is it total?
	\end{enumerate}
\end{exercises}

\chapter{The Set of Natural Numbers}\label{lec:natural-numbers}

\begin{goals}
\noindent\textbf{Lecture:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Re-introduce the natural numbers as a set
	\item Introduce sequences and recursively defined sequences
	\item Relate recursion to proofs by induction
\end{itemize}

\noindent\textbf{Study:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Be able to define simple functions by recursion
	\item Be able to prove explain how induction and recursion are related
\end{itemize}
\end{goals}

We have used $\NN$ informally to denote the set of natural numbers. 
It is time that we make the structure of $\NN$ explicit within our theory of sets and functions. 
It will turn out that $\NN$ is also a universal construction. 

Natural numbers provide a precise picture of counting and of putting things in an order: first, second, third, and so on.
Now that we have sets and functions we can consider a function $\fromto a\NN A$ to be an \emph{infinite sequence}: $a(0)$, $a(1)$, $a(2)$, \ldots.
When we do that, we sometimes write $a_0$, $a_1$, $a_2$, \ldots instead. Still $a$ itself is just function from $\NN$ to $A$. To emphasize the notation that 
$a$ represents an infinite sequence, we sometimes also write $(a_i)_{i\in I}$.

Much of what we discuss in this lecture has about it the feel of computer programming.
This is partly because natural numbers are the main objects of calculation.
We want to understand, for example, how to define a function like $n\mapsto n!$ ($n$ factorial) as a function from $\NN$ to $\NN$ by specifying how it behaves.
In particular, $0! = 1$ and $(n^\nxt)! = n^\nxt\cdot n!$ characterize factorial by spelling out how to calculate it.
For example,
\begin{align*}
	4!  &= 4 \cdot 3! \\
		&= 4 \cdot (3 \cdot 2!)\\
		&= 4 \cdot (3 \cdot (2 \cdot 1!))\\
		&= 4 \cdot (3 \cdot (2 \cdot (1 \cdot 0!)))\\
		&= 4 \cdot (3 \cdot (2 \cdot (1 \cdot 1)))
		&= 24
\end{align*}

It is quite common to think about a sequence in which $a_{n+1}$ is functionally related to $a_n$. 
For example, in the sequence $1, 2, 4, 8,\ldots$, the initial entry is $1$ and each successive entry is double its predecessor.

Indeed, if we know just those two facts -- the initial entry is $1$, and each subsequent entry is double its predecessor -- then we know how the entire sequence behaves.
Also, we know how to calculate the $n^{\text{th}}$ entry, by recursion just like factorial.

The most basic sequence, of course, is $0$, $1$, $2$, \ldots. 
Its initial entry is $0$ and each subsequent entry is the successor of its predecessor. 
So we think of the sequence that comprises $\NN$ as a universal recursively defined sequence.

\section{Sequences and Simple Recurrences}

Let us make the informal word \emph{sequence} official.

\begin{defn}
	A \emph{sequence in $A$} is a function $\fromto a\NN A$.
\end{defn}

As we studied in previous lectures, the basic vocabulary of natural numbers is that (i) there is a starting natural number, $0$, and (ii) for each natural number $n$ there is a next one, $n^\nxt$. 
To discuss successor in the language of sets and functions, we stipulate that successor is a function $\fromto \suc\NN\NN$ given by the rule $n\mapsto n^\nxt$.
So $\NN$ is not just a set. 
It comes with functions $\One \stackrel{\hat{0}}{\longrightarrow} \NN \stackrel{\suc}{\longleftarrow} \NN$.

Suppose $\One\stackrel{\hat{b}}{\longrightarrow}A\stackrel{r}{\longleftarrow}A$ is a similar structure.
Then we ought to be able to define a sequence in $A$, so that $a_0=b$, $a_1=r(b)$, $a_2=r(r(b))$, and so on. 
In general, $a_k$ should be determined by starting with $b$ and repeatedly applying $r$ a total of $k$ times. 

\begin{defn}\label{def:nno}
	A \emph{simple recurrence} is a set with functions $\One\stackrel{\hat{b}}{\longrightarrow}C\stackrel{r}{\longleftarrow}C$.
	
	A \emph{natural number set} is a simple recurrence $\One\stackrel{\hat{z}}{\longrightarrow}N\stackrel{s}{\longleftarrow}N$ so that for any other simple recurrence $\One\stackrel{\hat{b}}{\longrightarrow}C\stackrel{r}{\longleftarrow}C$, there is exactly one function $\fromto fNC$ so that $f\circ \hat{z} =\hat b$ and $f\circ s = r\circ f$.
\end{defn}

The principle we are interested in here is that simple recurrences determine sequences.

\begin{principle}\label{ax:nat-numbers}
	The collection of natural numbers is a set, denoted by $\NN$.
	Moreover, $\One \stackrel{\hat{0}}{\longrightarrow} \NN \stackrel{\suc}{\longleftarrow} \NN$.
	makes $\NN$ a natural numbers set.
	
	From a simple recurrence $\One \stackrel{\hat{b}}{\longrightarrow} C \stackrel{r}{\longleftarrow} C$, the corresponding unique sequence in $C$
	may be denoted by $\srec[b,r]$. So $\fromto {\srec[b,r]}\NN A$ is characterized by
	\begin{align*}
		\srec[b,r]_0 &= b\\
		\srec[b,r]_{n^\nxt} &= r(\srec[b,r]_n)
	\end{align*}
\end{principle}

Every simple recurrence in $C$ determines a sequence in $C$. 
On the other hand, it is not the case that every sequence is determined by a simple recurrence.
Take for example, the sequence $0,1,0,2,0,3,\ldots$. 
This can not be defined (at least not directly) by giving an initial entry and specifying successive entries based only on the predecessors. 
After all, the entries $1$, $2$, $3$ and so on all have the same preceding entry.

\section{Primitive Recursion}

Evidently, addition, multiplication, factorial, and other familiar functions should be definable using Principle \ref{ax:nat-numbers}. 
But there are problems to overcome: Addition is not a sequence, at least not in an obvious way. And factorial is not obviously definable by a simple recurrence
because we would need a function $\fromto r\NN\NN$ so that $n^\nxt! = r(n!)$
for all $n$. If, in place of $r$, we could use a function that depends on $n$ as well as on $n!$, we could define factorial recursively the usual way.


Putting things together, we consider a scheme that generalizes simple recursion to permit (i) dependence on a parameter not directly involved in the recursion, and
(ii) dependence on $n$ at each stage of the recursion.

\begin{defn}
	A \emph{primitive recurrence in $A$ (with parameters in $C$)} consists of two  functions $C\stackrel{b}{\longrightarrow} A\stackrel{r}{\longleftarrow}\NN\times C\times A$.
	
	A \emph{parametric sequence in $A$ with parameters in $C$} is a function
	$\fromto a{C\times \NN}A$. For a parametric sequence, we may write $a_{c,n}$
	instead of $a(c,n)$. 
\end{defn}

\begin{lemma}
	For any primitive recurrence $C \stackrel{b}{\longrightarrow} A \stackrel{r}{\longleftarrow} C\times \NN \times A$, there is a unique
	function $\fromto {\primrec[b,r]}{C\times \NN}A$ satisfying: 
	\begin{align*}
		\primrec[b,r]_{c,0} &= b(c)\\
		\primrec[b,r]_{c,k^\nxt} &= r(c,k,\primrec[b,r]_{c,k})
	\end{align*}

	\begin{proof}
		The proof of this is intricate enough that we do not give all the details here. 
		
		The idea of the proof is to use simple recursion to define a sequence of binary relations $R_0$, $R_1$, \ldots, from $C\times \NN$ to $A$. In other words, $R$ is a function from $\NN$ to $\Two^{(C\times \NN)\times A}$. 
		These relations will satisfy the following conditions for each $i\in\NN$:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item $R_i\subseteq R_{i^\nxt}$;
			\item $R_i$ is deterministic;
			\item $R_i$ is total on $\{0,\ldots, i-1\}$
		\end{itemize}
		Then we define $R$ to be the relation $(c,n)\mathrel{R}a$ if and only if $(c,n)R_i a$ holds for some $i\in \NN$. 
		It follows from the above conditions that $R$ is functional. So there is a function $\fromto f{C\times\NN}A$ for which $f(c,n)=a$ if and only if $(c,n)\mathrel{R}a$. By the construction of $R$, it will follow that $f$ satisfies  
		\begin{align*}
			f_{c,0} &= b(c)\\
			f_{c,k^\nxt} &= r(c,k,f_{c,k})
		\end{align*}
			
		Define $R_0=\emptyset$. 
		This is clearly deterministic and since $C\times \emptyset = \emptyset$, it is total on that $\emptyset$.
		Define $\fromto p{\Two^{(C\times\NN)\times A}}{\Two^{(C\times \NN)\times A}}$ by the following rules (writing $p_R$ for $p(R)$ to eliminate some confusing parentheses:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item $(c,0)\mathrel{p_R}b(c)$
			\item $(c,k^\nxt)\mathrel{p_R}x$ if and only if either
			 \begin{itemize}
			 	\item $(c,k^\nxt)\mathrel{R}x$ or
			 	\item for some $y$, $(c,k)\mathrel{R}y$ and $r(c,k,y)=x$.
			 \end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}
		Now we check that (i) if $R\subseteq S$, then $p_R\subseteq p_S$, (ii) if $R$ is deterministic then $p_R$ is deterministic, and (iii) if $R$ is total on $C\times \{0,\ldots, k-1\}$, then $p_R$ is total on $C\times \{0,\ldots,k\}$. 
		Consequently, defining $R_i$ by the simple recurrence $\srec[R_0,p]$, we can prove by induction that the conditions stated in the second paragraph hold. 
		Finally, by the way we constructed $R$, $f_{c,o} = b(c)$  and by induction on $k$, $f_{c,k^\nxt} = r(c,k,f_{c,k})$. 
	\end{proof}
\end{lemma}

\begin{example}
	The ``predecessor'' function is defined by the scheme $\pred(0)=0$ and $\pred(n^\nxt) = n$. 
	The primitive recurrence
	$\One \stackrel{\hat0}{\longrightarrow} \NN \stackrel{\pi_1}{\longleftarrow} \One\times\NN\times\NN$ where $\pi_1$ is the projection $(x,y,z)\mapsto y$ determines a function $\fromto g{\One\times \NN}{\NN}$ given by
	$g_{\bullet, 0} = 0$ and $g_{\bullet,n^\nxt} = \pi_2(\bullet, n, g_{\bullet, n}) = n$. Hence, we may define $\pred(n) = g_{\bullet, n}$
\end{example}

\begin{exercises}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item For a given function $\fromto f\NN\NN$, find a primitive recurrence that defines the function $n\mapsto \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}f(i)$. That is, result will be the sequence $0$, $f(0)$, $f(0)+f(1)$, $f(0)+f(1)+f(2)$, \ldots.
	\item Find a primitive recurrence that defines the function from $\NN\times \NN$ to $\NN$ given by the rule $(m,n)\mapsto m^n$.
	\item Define the operation of \emph{monus} $m\stackrel{.}{-} n$ to be $m-n$ when $m \geq n$ and to be $0$ otherwise by  a primitive recurrence.
	\item Define the factorial function by primitive recursion.
\end{enumerate}
\end{exercises}

\section{Lists}

For a set $A$, the lists of elements from $A$ also should form a set.
The structure of this set is similar to $\NN$.

\begin{defn}
	For a set $A$, a \emph{simple $A$-recurrrence} is a set with two functions
	$\One \stackrel{\hat b}{\longrightarrow} C \stackrel{r}{\longleftarrow} A\times C$.
	
	For a set $A$, an \emph{$A$-list set} is a simple $A$-recurrence 
	$\One \stackrel{\hat{e}}{\longrightarrow} L \stackrel{c}{\longleftarrow} A\times L$ so that for any simple $A$-recurrence $\One \stackrel{\hat b}{\longrightarrow} C \stackrel{r}{\longleftarrow} A\times C$ there is exactly one function $\fromto hLC$ so that 
	\begin{align*}
		h\circ \hat e 	&= \hat b\\
		h\circ c 		&= r\circ (\id_A\times h).
	\end{align*}
\end{defn}

\begin{principle}
	The collection of lists with items in $A$ is a set, denote by $\List[A]$.
	The functions $\fromto {\widehat{[\,]}}\One{\List[A]}$ and $\fromto c{A\times\List[A]}{\List[A]}$ defined by the rule $(a,L)\mapsto a:L$,
	constitute an $A$-list set.
	
	For $\One \stackrel{\hat b}{\longrightarrow} C \stackrel{r}{\longleftarrow} A\times C$, we reuse our notation for recursive functions defined from $\NN$
	and write $\srec[\hat b,r]$ for the unique function 
	satisfying $\srec[\hat b,r]([\,])= b$
	and $\srec[\hat b,r](a:L)= r(a, \srec[\hat b, r](L))$.  
\end{principle}

\begin{example}
	$\One \stackrel{\hat 0}{\longrightarrow} \NN \stackrel{+}{\longleftarrow} \NN\times \NN$ determine a function $\srec[\hat 0, +]$ from $\List(\NN)$ to $\NN$. The function satifies $\srec[\hat 0,+]([\,])= 0$ and $\srec[\hat 0,+](n:L)= n + s(L)$.
	So $\srec[0,+]$ returns the sum of items of a list natural numbers.
	Earlier, we wrote this as $\sum L$.
\end{example}


\begin{exercises}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item For a function $\fromto fAB$, specify a simple $A$ recurrence that defines the function
			\[\fromto {\map[f]}{\List[A]}{\List[B]}\] so that \[\map[f]([a_0,a_1,\ldots, a_{n-1}]) = [f(a_0),f(a_1),\ldots, f(a_{n-1})]\]
		\item Define concatenation in $\List[A]$ by a simple $A$ recurrence. [Hint: I am asking for a function from $\List[A]\times \List[A]$ to $\List[A]$, but simple $A$ recurrence alone will not do the job, because that can only define a function $\List[A]\to C$ for some  $C$. Do this instead: (i) specify a simple $A$-recurrence to define a function $\fromto c{\List[A]}{\List[A]^{\List[A]}}$ for which $c(M)(L)$ is the concatetation of $L$ followed by $M$, (ii) define $L\star M$ to be $c(M)(L)$.
		\item Write a scheme for ``primitive $A$ recursion''. Specified by a function $\fromto bPC$ and a function $\fromto r{P\times A\times \List[A] \times C}C$,
		write equations involving $b$ and $r$ that should determine a unique function $P\times \List[A]\to C$. 
		You do not need to prove that your scheme actually defines a function.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{exercises}

\chapter{Powersets}

The exponential $\Two^A$ for any set $A$ is the set of all characteristic maps on $A$.
Each element $k\in \Two^A$ corresponds to a subset of $A$ by $k^{-1}(\top) = \{x\in A\st k(x)=\top\}$. Vice versa, a subset $A\subseteq X$ determines a characteristic function $\fromto {\kappa_A}X\Two$ by the rule
\[x\mapsto \begin{cases}
			\top &\text{if $x\in A$}\\
			\bot &\text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]
So $\Two^X$ is, in a sense, \emph{representative} of the collection of all subsets of $X$. 
It is convenient also to suppose that the actual collection of subsets of a set $A$ forms a set.
This should ``behave'' exactly like $\Two^A$, but concretely, consist of subsets rather than characteristic functions.

\begin{principle}\label{ax:powerset}
	For any set $A$, the collection of subsets of $A$ is a set, denoted by $\powerset(A)$, called the \emph{power set of $A$}. Moreover, there is a function $\fromto {\ni_A}{\powerset(A)\times A}\Two$ defined by 
	\[{\mathord\ni}_A(B,x) = \begin{cases}
	\top, &\text{ if } x\in B\\
	\bot &\text{otherwise}
	\end{cases}
	\]
	The function $\ni_A$ is an evaluation map, meaning that 
	for any function $\fromto f{C\times A}\Two$, there is a unique function $\fromto {f^\dagger}C{\powerset(A)}$ for which $f = {\mathord\ni}_A\circ (f^\dagger \times \id_A)$. The function $f^\dagger$ 
	is given by the rule $c\mapsto \{x\in A\st f(c,x)=\top\}$.
\end{principle}

For a function $\fromto fAB$, ${\mathord\ni}_B\circ (\id_{\powerset(B)}\times f)$ is a function from $\powerset(B)\times A$ to $\Two$. So there is a unique function
from $\powerset(B)$ to $\powerset(A)$ determined by $f$. 

\begin{defn}
	For $\fromto fAB$, let $\fromto {f^-}{\powerset(B)}{\powerset(A)}$ denote
	the unique function for which ${\mathord\ni}_B\circ (\id_{\powerset(B)}\times f) = {\mathord\ni}_A\circ(f^-\times \id_A)$. In terms of elements, $f^-$ satsifies
	\[x\in f^-(Y) \text{if and only if } f(x)\in Y\]
	for every $Y\subseteq B$.  So $f^-$ is given by the rule $Y\mapsto \{x\in A\st f(x)\in Y\}$
\end{defn}

This notation does not clash much with our earlier definition of inverse image of an element, $f^-(b)$, because 
$f^-(b)$ in the earlier usage is the same as $f^-(\{b\})$ in the new usage.

\section{Intersections, Unions, Residuals, Differences and Negations}

Suppose $A$ and $B$ are subsets of $U$. 
Then it makes sense to consider the elements that $A$ and $B$ have in common. 
For example, for $A$ being the set of even natural numbers and $B$ the set of perfect squares, we might want to concentrate on the set of even, perfect squares.
Generally, the elements in common ought to constitute another subset of $X$.
This is called the \emph{intersection} and is denoted by $A\cap B$.

Likewise, we might consider merging $A$ and $B$ into a single set (in our example, the set of numbers that are either even or perfect squares).
This is called the \emph{union}.
Related to intersection, there is a largest set $C$ so that $C\cap A\subseteq B$. 
This is called the \emph{residual}, and is denoted by $A\Rightarrow B$.
Flipping this the other way, there is also a smallest set $C$ so that $A\subseteq B\cup C$. This is called the \emph{set difference} and is denoted by $A\setminus B$. 

These operations on subsets of $X$ are closely related to the logic of propositions.
Imagine that $U$ consists of a ``universe'' of possible worlds and subsets of $U$ are collections of worlds where certain things are true.
For example, perhaps $P\subseteq U$ is the set of worlds in which pigs fly;
$K\subseteq X$ is the set of worlds in which kittens smoke cigars.
So $P\cap K$ is the set of worlds in which pigs fly \emph{and} kittens smoke cigars.
Likewise, $P\cup K$ is the set of worlds in which \emph{Either} pigs fly \emph{or} kittens smoke cigars.
And $P\Rightarrow K$ is the set of worlds in which it is true that if pigs fly, \emph{then} kittens smoke cigars. 

Understanding the interaction of $\cap$, $\cup$ and $\Rightarrow$ is thus closely related to the logic of ``and'', ``or'' and ``implies''. If we add a sentence ``False'' that is never true and another one ``True'' that is always true, then the logic of ``and'', ``or'' and ``implies'' form what is called a \emph{Heyting algebra}.

More specially, ``implies'' interacts with ``False'' in a useful way.
It turns out that ``$P$ implies False'' is essentially the same as saying ``$P$ is not the case''. And if ``$P$ is not the case'' is not the case, then ``$P$'' must be true. This oservation indicates that the Heyting algebra of subsets is actually a \emph{Boolean algebra}.

The operation of set difference is not as familiar in a logical setting. 
It corresponds to``but not'', so $P\setminus K$ is the set of worlds  in which pigs fly, but kittens do not smoke cigars. 
 
%First, we need to understand what is means for a variable to \emph{appear free} in an expression.
%In $\{x\in A \st f(x)=g(x)\}$ the variable \emph{appears bound}.
%This means, roughly, that the meaning of the expression does not depend on a value for $x$, so we are not ``free'' to interpret $x$.
%In contrast, $f$ and $g$ appear free in the same expression because the meaning of the expression depends on the meanings of $f$ and $g$.
%We are ``free'' to choose what they mean.
%Similarly, in the English phrase, ``$m + n = n + m$ for all natural numbers $m$ and $n$'' the variables $m$ and $n$ are bound.
%But in the phrase ``$m+k = n$ for some $k$'' the variables $m$ and $n$ are free and the variable $k$ is bound.
%An important feature of bound variables is that we may rename them without changing the meaning, so long as we do so systematically.
%For example, ``$m+j=n$'' for some $j$'' means exactly the same as ``$m+k=n''$ for some $k$''.
%But we can't just swap $m$ for some other variable without changing the meaning. 
%
%In the following, we write $P(x,y,z)$ for an expression in which $x$, $y$ and $z$ may appear, but are not required. 
%We can allow expressions in a mix of English and mathematical notation, so long as the meanings are clear.
%

\begin{lemma}
	In the following, let $X$ be a set, and $A,B\subseteq X$ be subsets.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item There is a subset of $X$, denoted by $A\cap B$, so that for every $C\subseteq X$, $C\subseteq A\cap B$ if and only if $C\subseteq A$ and $C\subseteq B$.
		\item There is a subset of $X$, denoted by $A\cup B$, so that for every $C\subseteq X$, $A\cup B\subseteq C$ if and only if $A\subseteq C$ and $B\subseteq C$.
		\item There is a subset of $X$, denoted by $A\Rightarrow B$, so that for every $C\subseteq X$, $C\subseteq A\Rightarrow B$ if and only if $C\cap A\subseteq B$.
		\item There is a subset of $X$, denoted by $A\setminus B$, so that for every $C\subseteq X$, $A\setminus B\subseteq C$ if and only if $A\subseteq B\cup C$.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\begin{proof}
		$A$ and $B$ are determined by characteristic functions $\fromto{\kappa_A}X\Two$ and $\fromto {\kappa_B}X\Two$.
		So $\rangle\kappa_A,\kappa_B\langle$ is a function from $X$ to $\Two\times \Two$. 
		If we compose with a function $\fromto h{\Two\times \Two}\Two$, we have another characteristic function on $X$. 
		So this determines another subset of $X$. So all of the above constructions amount to defining suitable functions $\Two\times\Two\to\Two$.
		
		The four functions corresponding to the subset operations can be given by tables. In these tables, we read the first argument on the left, and the second argument on the top.
		\begin{center}
			\begin{tabular}{ c|| c | c |}
				$\wedge$ & $\bot$ & $\top$ \\
				\hline\hline
				$\bot$ & $\bot$ & $\bot$ \\ 
				\hline
				$\top$ & $\bot$ & $\top$ \\ 
				\hline
			\end{tabular}
			\qquad
			\begin{tabular}{ c|| c | c |}
				$\vee$ & $\bot$ & $\top$ \\
				\hline\hline
				$\bot$ & $\bot$ & $\top$ \\ 
				\hline
				$\top$ & $\top$ & $\top$ \\ 
				\hline
			\end{tabular} 
			\qquad
			\begin{tabular}{ c|| c | c |}
				$\to$ & $\bot$ & $\top$ \\
				\hline\hline
				$\bot$ & $\top$ & $\top$ \\ 
				\hline
				$\top$ & $\bot$ & $\top$ \\ 
				\hline
			\end{tabular} 
			\qquad
			\begin{tabular}{ c|| c | c |}
				$-$ & $\bot$ & $\top$ \\
				\hline\hline
				$\bot$ & $\bot$ & $\bot$ \\ 
				\hline
				$\top$ & $\top$ & $\bot$ \\ 
				\hline
			\end{tabular} 
			
		\end{center}
	
		So for each $h \in \{\wedge,\vee,\to,-\}$, there  is a subset $(h\circ\langle \kappa_A,\kappa_B\rangle)^-(\top)$.
		
		It is routine to check that for $h=\mathord\wedge$, the result is $A\cap B$;
		for $h=\mathord\vee$, the result is $A\cup B$; for $h=\mathord\to$, the result is $A \Rightarrow B$; and for $h=\mathord-$, the result is $A \setminus B$.
	\end{proof}
\end{lemma}

This lemma, together with the fact that $\emptyset$ is the smallest element of $\powerset(X)$ and $X$ is the largest, can be summarized by saying that $\cap$, $\cup$, $\Rightarrow$, $\emptyset$ and $X$ make $\powerset(X)$ into what is known as a \emph{Heyting algebra}. 
We spell out the axioms for Heyting algebras in the next section, but generally speaking these are the structures that correspond to a sort of minimal version of propositional logic in which ``and'', ``or'', ``implies'', ``true'' and ``false'' interact in natural ways. Likewise, ``or'', ``and'', ``but not'', ``false'' and ``true'' interact in natural ways to determine a co-Heyting algebra. 

Additionally, ``implies'' and ``false'' interact in stronger ways, as do ``but not'' and ``true''. 
In particular, $\powerset(X)$ is a \emph{Boolean algebra}. 
This means the logic is based on a stronger interaction called the Law of Double Negation (or equivalently the Law of the Excluded Middle). 
Let us abbreviate $A\Rightarrow\emptyset$ by writing $A^*$ (read this informally as ``not $A$).
Then the Law of Double Negation asserts that double negations do not change anything: $A^{**} = A$.

\begin{lemma}
	In $\powerset(X)$, $A^{**} = A$.
	
	\begin{proof}
		Calculating the members of $\neg A$, it is easy to check that for every element $x\in X$, either $x\in A$ or $x\in A^*$, but not both. 
		So $x\in A^{**}$ if and only if $x\notin A^*$ if and only if $x\in A$. 
		
		Put differently, define the function $\fromto {\mathord\neg}\Two\Two$ by $\neg\top=\bot$ and $\neg\bot = \top$.
		Then $A^*$ is defined by $(\neg\circ\kappa_A)^-(\top)$.
		Obviously, $\neg\circ \neg = \id_\Two$.
		As with the other operations, it is now routine to check that $A^{**}=A$.
	\end{proof}
\end{lemma}

The Law of Double Negation is precisely the property that distinguishes Boolean algebras from general Heyting algebras. 
That is, one can define the term ``Boolean algebra'' to mean ``Heyting algebra that satisfies the Law of Double Negation.''
So $\powerset(X)$ is indeed a Boolean algebra. 

\begin{exercises}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item An easy consequence of Double Negation is that $A\Rightarrow \emptyset = U\setminus A$. Prove it.
	\end{enumerate}

\section{Laws of Finitary Set Operations}

As we mentioned, $\powerset(X)$ forms a Boolean algebra. 
This means that $\cup$, $cup$, $\Rightarrow$, $\emptyset$ and $X$ satisfy various laws. 
We spell the most important out here.

Several remarks are in order.
\begin{itemize}
	\item The Semilattice Laws describe how $\cap$ and $\cup$ behave without any interaction between the two. 
	In fact, any binary operation that is associative, commutative and idempotent is called a \emph{semilattice operation}.
	\item The Lattice Laws describe how $\cap$ and $\cup$ interact.
	The two Absorption Laws together are equivalent to the Ordering Law. For 
	suppose $A = A\cup(A\cap B)$ holds for all $A$ and $B$.
	Now suppose $X=Y\cap X$. Then $Y\cup X = Y\cup (X\cap Y)=Y$. 
	Conversely, suppose $A=B\cap A$ implies $B\cup A = B$ for all $A$ and $B$. Then $(X\cap Y) = (X\cap Y)\cap X$. So $X \cup (X\cap Y) = X$.
	\item The remaining laws are stated in terms of $\subseteq$ instead of equality. Becaause of the Ordering Laws, $A\subseteq B$ is equivalent to $A= B\cap A$ and also equivalent to $B = A\cup B$.
	\item The Bounded Lattice Laws indicate that $U$ is the unit element for $\cap$
	and $\emptyset$ is the unit element for $\cup$. It follows that $\emptyset$ is the smallest element of $\powerset(U)$ and $U$ is the largest.
	\item The Residuation and Co-residuation Laws indicate that $A\Rightarrow B$ 
	and $A\setminus B$ are defined as \emph{duals} of one another.
	\item In the Double Negation Law recall that $A^*$ is defined to be $A\Rightarrow\emptyset$. Since $A\cap \emptyset \subseteq A\Rightarrow \emptyset$, it follows from Residuation that $A\subseteq A^{**}$. So in fact, 
	$A = A^**$. 
	\item If we defined $A^\dagger = U\setminus A$, then in any co-Heyting algebra, $A^{\dagger\dagger}\subseteq A$. In a Boolean algebra $A^\dagger= A^*$.
	\item With respect to Distributivity, in any lattice, the opposite inclusions hold: $A\cap B\subseteq A\cap(B\cup C)$ and $A\cap B\subseteq A\cap (B\cup C)$,
	so $(A\cap B)\cup (A\cap C)\subseteq A\cap (B\cup C)$. Similarly, for the opposite inclusion for the second Distributive Law.
	\item The Distributivity laws are equivalent to each other. Suppose $A\cap (B\cup C)\subseteq (A\cap B)\cup (A\cap C)$ is true for all $A$, $B$ and $C$. 
	Then $(X\cup Y)\cap (X\cup Z) \subseteq ((X\cup Y)\cap X)\cup ((X\cup Y)\cap Z) = X\cup ((X\cup Y)\cap Z)\subseteq X\cup ((X\cap Z)\cup (Y\cap Z)) = X\cup (Y\cap Z)$ 
	\item The Heyting (or co-Heyting) Law implies Distributivity. Obviously,
	$A\cap B\subseteq (A\cap B)\cup (A\cap C)$, so $B\subseteq A\Rightarrow ((A\cap B)\cup (A\cap C))$. Likewise $C\subseteq A\Rightarrow ((A\cap B)\cup (A\cap C))$. So $B\cup C\subseteq A\Rightarrow ((A\cap B)\cup (A\cap C))$. And again using Residuation, $A\cap (B\cup C)\subseteq (A\cap B)\cup (A\cap C)$.
	\end{itemize}


\begin{exercises}
	In the following, assume that $U$ is a set, and all other sets are subsets of $U$.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Prove, using only the Semilattice Laws, the Absorption Laws and the Bounded Lattice Laws, that $A\cap \emptyset = \emptyset$. Likewise, show that $A\cup U = U$.
		\item Prove, using only the Semilattice and Lattice Laws, that the two Distribution Laws are equivalent. That is, show that if $A\cap(B\cup C)\subseteq (A\cap B)\cup (A\cap C)$ holds for all $A,B,C$, then
		so does $(A\cup B)\cap (A\cup C)\subseteq A\cup(B\cap C)$. Hint: Let $X=A\cup B$, $Y= A$ and $Z=C$. So $(A\cup B)\cap(A\cup C) = X\cap (Y\cup Z)$. Now use the first distributivity law, followed by absorption, then a second use of distributivity, and association and finally a second use of absorption.
		\item Prove, using only the Semilattice, Lattice and Heyting Algebra Laws, the Distributivity Law (either one).
		\item Prove, using only the Semilattice, Lattice Laws, Heyting Algebra and Boolean Algebra Laws, that the two de~Morgan's Laws hold.
		\item Prove that $A\Rightarrow B = A^* \cup B$, using any method. 
		\item Prove that $A\setminus B = A\cap B^*$, using any method.

\section{Quantifiers and Completeness}

Consider how we might try to define the set of perfect square natural numbers.
These are the natural numbers of the form $m^2$ for a natural number $m$.
So the first few are $0$, $1$, $4$, $9$, $16$ and so on.
We would be right to define this set by $\{n\in \NN\st \text{for some $m\in\NN$, $m^2=n$}\}$.
We need to make sense of this, since ``for some $m\in \NN$, \ldots'' does not look like anything we have encountered yet.
Just as we abbreviated ``and'' with symbol $\wedge$ and ``or'' with $\vee$, we will abbreviate ``for some $n\in\NN$, \ldots'' as $\exists n\in \NN,\ldots$. 

Suppose $\fromto PX\Two$ is a characteristic function on $X$.
We will write $\{x\in X\st P(x)\}$ instead of $\{x\in X\st P(x)=\top\}$, mostly to avoid some clutter, but also because this allows for more informal descriptions.
Using this notation, we can form subsets by writing things like $\{x\in X\st P(x)\wedge Q(x)\}$, to denote the subset of elements satisfying two conditions (this is an intersection).
Similarly, we can also write $\{x\in X\st P(x)\vee Q(x)\}$ for a union,
$\{x\in X\st P(x)\to Q(x)\}$ for a residual, and $\{x\in X\st \neg P(x)\}$ for a complement.

\begin{defn}
	For sets $W$ and $X$ and subset $C\subseteq X$, write $\{(w,x)\in W\times X\st x\in C\}$ for the subset of $W\times X$ defined by $pi_1^-(C)$.
\end{defn}

\begin{lemma}
	For sets $W$ and $X$ and subset $R\subseteq{W\times X}$, there is a subset of $X$, denoted by $\{x\in X\st \exists w\in W.R(w,x)\}$ so that for all $C\subseteq X$, 
	\[\text{$\{x\in X\st \exists w\in W.R(w,x)\} \subseteq C$ if and only if $R \subseteq \{(w,x)\in W\times X\st x\in C\}$}.\]
	Also, there is a subset of $X$, denoted by $\{x\in X\st \forall w\in W.R(w,x)\}$ so that for all $\fromto PX\Two$,
	\[\text{$C \subseteq \{x\in X\st \forall w\in W.R(w,x)\}$ if and only if $\{(w,x) \in W\times X\st x\in C\}\subseteq R$}.\]

	\begin{proof}
		The proof of this is fairly technical and, for now, is beyond the scope of this discussion.
		Concretely, $\{x\in X\st \exists w\in W.R(w,x)\}$ consists of those $x\in X$ so that $R(w,x) = \top$ for some $w\in W$;
		$\{x\in X\st \forall w\in W.R(w,x)\}$ consists of those $x\in X$ so that $R(w,x)=\top$ for all $w\in W$.
		This justifies our notation: $\exists w\in W,R(w,x)$ is read as ``there \emph{exists} $w\in W$ so that $R(w,x)$;''
		$\forall w\in W, R(w,x)$'' is read as ``for \emph{all} $w\in W$, $R(w,x)$.''
	\end{proof}
\end{lemma}

We use this lemma to generalize $\cup$ and $\cap$ to arbitrary sets of subsets.

\begin{defn}
Let $\fromto AI{\powerset(X)}$ be a function into the powerset of $X$.
We may write $A_i$ instead  of $A(i)$ to emphasize that each $A_i$ is
a set. 
Then define 
\begin{align*}
\bigcup_{i\in I}A_i &= \{x\in X\st \exists i\in I.x\in A_i\}
\end{align*}
\end{defn}

According to Lemma \ref{lem:existential-set}, $\bigcup_{i\in I}A_i$ is again a subset of $X$, generalizing $\cup$ to the union of arbitrary families of subsets, rather than just two.
In this sense, $\powerset(X)$ is \emph{complete}.
That is, the union of any family of subsets of $X$ exists.
It is this fact that justifes saying that $\powerset(X)$ is a \emph{complete} Boolean algebra.

\begin{exercises}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Show that $\bigcup_{i\in I}A_i\subseteq C$ if and only if $A_k\subseteq C$ holds every $k\in I$.
		\item Define $\bigcap_{i\in I}A_i$ in analogy with $\bigcup_{i\in I}A_i$.
		\item For $I=\emptyset$, what is $\bigcup_{i\in I}A_i$?
	\end{enumerate}
\end{exercises}

\section{Atomicity}

The complete Boolean algebras $\powerset(X)$ have one more feature that characterizes powersets among other complete Boolean algebras.
They are \emph{atomic}. 
This means, roughly, that all subsets are built from the simplest ones.

An \emph{atom} of $\powerset(X)$ is a subset $A$ with the property that $\emptyset\subseteq B\subseteq A$ implies $B=\emptyset$ or $B=A$. That is, there is nothing strictly between $\emptyset$ and $A$. 
Clearly, the singleton subsets of $X$ are the atoms $\powerset(X)$.

\begin{lemma}
	For any set $X$, the rule $x\mapsto \{x\}$ determines a function from $X$ to $\powerset(X)$.
	
	\begin{proof}
		Define the \emph{diagonal} subset of $X\times X$ as $\Delta_X = \{(x,y)\in X\times X \st x= y\}$.
		This is the equalizer of the functions $\pi_0$ and $\pi_1$.
		Let $\fromto {\delta_X}{X\times X}\Two$ be the characteristic map for $\Delta_X$. So $\delta_X(x,y)=\top$ if and only if $x=y$. 
		Let $\fromto sX{\powerset(X)}$ be the unique function for which ${\mathord\in}_X\circ (s\circ \id_X)= \delta_X$.
		In other words ${\mathord\ni}_X(s(x),y)=\delta_X(x,y)$.
		Since ${\mathord\ni}_X(s(x),y) =\top$ if and only if $y\in s(x)$, it is the case that $y\in s(x)$ if and only if $x=y$.
		So $s(x) = \{x\}$. 
	\end{proof}
\end{lemma}

Now every subset of $X$ is obtained as a union of singletons: $A = \bigcup_{x\in A}\{x\}$. 
For a complete Boolean algebra, this is what is meant by saying that $\powerset(X)$ is a complete \emph{atomic} Boolean algebra. 
Although we do not investigate this here, any complete atomic Boolean algebra has the same structure as $\powerset(X)$ for some $X$. The structure of $\powerset(X)$ is even preserved by inverse images.

\begin{lemma}
	For any function $\fromto fXY$, any $\fromto BI{\powerset(Y)}$, it is the case that $f^{-1}(\bigcup_{i\in I}B_i) = \bigcup_{i\in I}f^{-1}(B_i)$
	and $f^{-1}(\bigcap_{i\in I}B_i) = \bigcap_{i\in I}f^{-1}(B_i)$.
	
	\begin{proof}
		$x\in f^{-1}(\bigcup_{i\in I}B_i)$ if and only if $f(x)\in \bigcup_{i\in I}B_i$ if and only if $f(x)\in B_k$ for some $k\in I$ if and only if $x\in f^{-1}(B_k)$ for some $k\in I$ if and only if $x\in \bigcup_{i\in I}f^{-1}(B_i)$. THe proof for $\bigcap$ is similar with ``for some \ldots'' replaced by ``for all \ldots".  
	\end{proof}
\end{lemma}

\begin{exercises}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Write out $\powerset(\{a,b,c\})$
		\item Write out $\powerset(\emptyset)$
		\item Is it the case that $\emptyset \in \powerset(A)$ for any set $A$? Explain. 
		\item Write out $\powerset(\Two\times \Two)$ and $\powerset(\powerset(\Two))$. Pay attention to writing them in a systematic way, so that it is clear you have actually listed everything.
		\item I claim that $\powerset(\emptyset)$ is a terminal set (Definition \ref{def:terminal}). Justify the claim.
		\item I claim that $\powerset(\emptyset)\in \powerset(\powerset(\emptyset))$ is a subset classifier (Definition \ref{def:subset-classifier}). Justify the claim.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{exercises}

\section{Forward images}

For a function $\fromto fAB$ the function $\fromto {f^-}{\powerset(C)}{\powerset(B)}$ has what is known as an \emph{upper adjoint}. 

\begin{defn}
	For $\fromto fXY$, define $\fromto {f^+}{\powerset(X)}{\powerset(Y)}$ by the rule $A= \bigcup\{B\subseteq Y\st f^-(B)\subseteq A\}$. The subset 
	$f^+(A)\subseteq Y$ is called the \emph{forward image of $A$ with respect to $f$}.
\end{defn}

It follows easily that $f^-(B)\subseteq A$ if and only if $B\subseteq f^+(A)$.
In terms of elements, 
\begin{align*}
f^+(A) &= \{y\in Y\st \exists B\subseteq Y, f^-(B)\subseteq A \wedge y\in B\}\\
       &= \{y\in Y\st \exists x\in A.f(x)=y\}.
\end{align*}

There is also a lower adjoint of $f^-$, but as it is less common, we do not investigate it here.

The important features of $f^+$ are easily checked. First, $f^+$ preserves atoms.
That is, $f^+(\{x\}) = \{f(x)\}$. 
Second, $f^-$ preserves all unions So $f^+(\bigcup_{i\in I}A_i) = \bigcup_{i\in I}f^+(A_i)$. Note that $f$ does not necessarily preserve intersections.

\begin{exercises}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Define a function $\fromto fXY$ and two subsets $A,B\subseteq X$ so that $f(X)\cap f(Y) \neq f(X\cap Y)$. Try to find the smallest example you can.
		\item Prove that for any function $\fromto fXY$ and any $A\subseteq X$, the inclusion $A\subseteq f^-(f^+(A))$ holds.
		\item Prove that for any function $\fromto fXY$ and any $B\subseteq Y$, the inclusion $f^+(f^-(B))\subseteq B$ holds.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{exercises}

\chapter{Additional Constructions}

Although not strictly needed for most applications, mathematicians generally agree that any two sets, no matter how they are related, can be merged into a single set with elements taken fom both. We mtake this as an additional principle.

\begin{principle}
	For any sets $X$ and $Y$, there is a set $Z$ so that $X\subseteq Z$ and $Y\subseteq Z$. Hence, $X\cup Y$ is subset of this $Z$. 
\end{principle}

The fact that this principle is not necessary is a bit technical. 
It is because the principles we already have can be employed to construct a set that is not equal to $X\cup Y$ but that behaves exactly the same as $X\cup Y$.
Certainly it is a reasonable principle that make many other things easier. It says that the union of any two sets exists.

The sets $\emptyset$ and $\One$ behave in opposite ways, in the sense that for any set $X$, (i) there is exactly one function from $\emptyset$ to $X$ and (ii) there is exactly one function from $X$ to $\One$. 
We signalled this by refering to $\emptyset$ as \emph{initial} and $\One$ as \emph{terminal}. 
We say that the notion of an initial set is \emph{dual} to the notion of a terminal set. 
The constructions of equalizers and products have duals called \emph{co-equalizers} and \emph{co-products}. 
To describe co-equalizers leads to another useful idea of constructing a \emph{quotient} of a set. We build the co-product first.

\begin{defn}
	For sets $X$ and $Y$, a \emph{co-table} is a set with a pair of functions
	$X\stackrel{f}{\longrightarrow}C\stackrel{g}{\longleftarrow}Y$.
	
	A \emph{co-product} is a co-table $X\stackrel{i}{\longrightarrow}S\stackrel{j}{\longleftarrow}Y$
	so that for any co-table $X\stackrel{f}{\longrightarrow}C\stackrel{g}{\longleftarrow}Y$
	there is exactly one function $\fromto cSC$ so that $f = c\circ i$ and
	$g = c\circ j$. 
\end{defn}

\begin{lemma}
	Any two sets $X$ and $Y$ have a co-product.
	
	\begin{proof}
		Define $X\uplus Y = \{0\}\times X \cup \{1\}\times Y$.
		So the set $X\uplus Y$ consists of pairs
		$(i,w)$ where $i=0$ and $w\in X$ or $i=1$ and $w\in Y$.
		Think of $X\uplus Y$ has consisting if a copy of $X$ and a completely separate copy of $Y$.
		
		Define the two functions $\fromto {\inj_0}X{X\uplus Y}$ and $\fromto {\inj_1}Y{X\uplus Y}$ by $\inj_0(x) = (0,x)$ and $\inj_1(y) = (1,y)$. 
		Now, for any pair of functions $X\stackrel{f}{\longrightarrow}C\stackrel{g}{\longleftarrow}Y$
		define $\fromto {[f,g]}{X\uplus Y}C$ by cases:
		\[[f,g](i,w) = \begin{cases}
		f(w) &\text{if $i=0$}\\
		g(w) &\text{if $i=1$.}
		\end{cases}\]
		Evidently, $[f,g]\circ \inj_0 = f$ and $[f,g]\circ\inj_1 = g$. And clearly, no other function than $[f,g]$ has this property.		
	\end{proof}
\end{lemma}

The set $X\uplus Y$ is sometimes called the \emph{disjoint union} of $X$ and $Y$. It is a union, preceded by ``marking'' each $x\in X$ by putting it into a pair $(0,x)$ and marking each $y\in Y$ differently by putting it into a pair $(1,y)$. Hence it is the union of disjoint copies of $X$ and $Y$. 

\begin{exercises}
	Let $A= \{a,b,c,d,e\}$ and $B = \{w,x,y,z,a,b,c,\}$
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Calculate $A\uplus B$
		\item Calculate $A\uplus \emptyset$
		\item Find a bijection between $\NN$ and $\One\uplus \NN$.
		\item Find a bijection between $\One \uplus \One$ and $\Two$.
		\item For any sets $X$, $Y$ and $Z$, define a bijection betweeen
		$X\times (Y\uplus Z)$ and $(X\times Y )\uplus (X\times Z)$.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{exercises}

Sometimes, elements of a set $X$ will be classified into ``like'' kinds. 
For example, we might classify the natural numbers into even and odd. 
We might classify poker cards according to suit, ignoring the rank -- or by rank, ignoring suit. 
Or, if $C$ is  set modelling a Discrete Mathematics class, we might classify the elements (students) according to their grade: A, B, etc. 
Situations like this is modelled by what is known as a \emph{partion} of a set. If we also wish to think of all A students as being ``equivalent'', all B students as being ``equivalent'', we model this by what is known as an \emph{equivalence relation}.

\begin{defn}
	For a set $X$, a \emph{partition of $X$} is a set $P\subseteq\powerset(X)$
	so that $\bigcup_{A\in P}A = X$ and for every $A,B\in P$, if $A\neq B$ then $A\cap B=\emptyset$. The sets in $P$ are called \emph{blocks}. 
	
	For a set $X$, an \emph{equivalence relation on $X$} is a binary relation satisfying
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $x \mathrel{E}x$ for all $x\in X$,
		\item $x\mathrel{E}y$ annd $y\mathrel{E}z$ implies $z\mathrel{E}z$ for all $x,y,z\in X$, and 
		\item $x\mathrel{E}y$ imples $y\mathrel{E}x$
	\end{itemize}
	
	For a partition $P$ define the relation $\equiv_P\equiv_P\subseteq X\times X$ by $x\equiv_P y$ if and only if for some $A\in P$, $x\in A$ and $y\in A$.
	
	For an equivalence relation $E$ and an element $x\in X$, let $[x]_E = \{y\in X\st x\mathrel{E} y\}$. So $x\mapsto [x]_E$ defines a function from $X$ to $\powerset(X)$. Let ${\mathcal P}_{E} = \{[x]_E\st x\in X\}$.
	That is, ${\mathcal P}_E$ is the range of the function $[\cdot]_E$.
\end{defn}

The two notions, partition and equivalence relation, are essentially the same in the sense that there is a natural bijection between partitions and equivalence relations.

\begin{lemma}
	Let $X$ be any set. Then
	
	\begin{itemize}
		]
	\end{itemize}set $X$ and partition $P$ of $X$, the relation $\equiv_P$ is an equivalence relation on $X$. 
	
	For any equivalence relation $E$ on $X$, the collection ${\mathcal P}_E$ forms a partition of $X$.
	
	Moreover, for any partition $P$ of $X$, $P = \mathcal P_{\equiv_P}$
	For any equivalence relation $E$ on $X$, $E = \equiv_{{\mathcal P}_E}$.

	So $x\mapsto [x]_E$ determines an onto function from $X$ to ${\mathcal P}_E$. 
	\begin{proof}
		Exercise.
	\end{proof} 
\end{lemma}

\begin{defn}
	For functions $X\doublerightarrow{f}{g}Y$, a \emph{co-solution} is a set $C$ with function $\fromto cYC$ so that $c\circ f=c\circ g$.
	
	A \emph{co-equalizer} is a \emph{co-solution} $\fromto qYQ$ so that for any co-solution $\fromto cYC$, there is a unique function $\fromto eCQ$ so that $c = e\circ q$.
\end{defn}

\begin{lemma}
	Any $X\doubleleftarrow{f}{g}Y$ has a co-equalizer.
